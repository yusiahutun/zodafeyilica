"I think one of the most exciting parts of Cecilia is how innocent she is at the beginning, and the journey she goes on.

It never went into production, but she could not get the role of Cecilia out of her mind.</p><p id=ehFHO_rlHf_ data-wc=33>"I couldn't stop thinking about it. Every year, I would call my agent and ask them what happened to it, but nothing had. And then ten years later, here we are," she says.</p><p id=emUWPq75Ked data-wc=27>"I'm so happy we brought this story to life and that [director] Michael Mohan, whom I'd worked with on Everything Sucks! and The Voyeurs, could do it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2d8fad36cbd3-sydney-sweeney-immaculate.jpg><p id=eZjOaaIBmib data-wc=53>As well as playing the leading lady, Sydney is also one of the film's producers, a career move she was keen to make. "It's something I have always wanted to do. I love building my characters from the ground up, and producing gives me the chance to do that on a greater scale.</p><p id=elxpwIgW3ei data-wc=52>"I find it fascinating," she continues. "There are so many elements and people that have to come together to make a movie work, even before an actor shows up on set. I love being part of that process from the beginning to the end. I want to be a part of everything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b147e561bd9c-gettyimages-2071906292.jpg><p id=eht1oBotL4u data-wc=36>"I learnt so much on Immaculate.

You can't just do it on your own; it's a collaboration."</p><p id=ecAB7jSkcco data-wc=23>Italy was an "amazing backdrop" for the film, she adds. "I truly feel as though the locations are characters in their own right.</p><p id=eTz-dxxYmD- data-wc=29>"Adam Reamer, who helped design and set-decorate everything, is so incredibly talented – he elevated every room.

She taught me so much about the process and the industry. I will always be grateful to her."</p><p id=e4LOHd4HwOTE data-wc=76>Even Sydney can't believe what is happening in her life right now, having received Emmy nominations for both Euphoria and The White Lotus. "I'm still in denial that it happened. I was filming at the time, so I didn't really allow myself time to process it all," she says. "Even when I was at the Emmys, I don't think it hit me.<strong>&nbsp;I always have impostor syndrome with that kind of stuff, but it is incredible.</strong></p><p id=ec9tS29h9fNv data-wc=35>"Olivia from The White Lotus and Cassie from Euphoria mean so much to me as characters. I loved playing them and I love the people I got to work with on both of those sets.</p><p id=exLd_vIb5fbK data-wc=18>"Having both shows recognised in that way is incredible.
