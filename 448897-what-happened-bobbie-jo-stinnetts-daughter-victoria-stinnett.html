Imagine getting slain and having your unborn child extracted from your womb. According to the local sheriff that oversaw Bobbie Jo Stinnett's case, it was one of the most gruesome crimes he had ever seen. Before the unfortunate incident happened, Bobbie was a pregnant 23-year-old American woman living in Skidmore, Missouri. Everyone has been wondering what happened to Bobbie Jo Stinnett’s daughter.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8a048d09fcef2ea2.jpeg><p class=align-left>It was a scene reminiscent of a horror movie. According to an affidavit, blood spattered all over, and the dead victim was holding the killer's blonde hair in her hands. Detectives were left to imagine how unempathetic the killer must have been to commit such atrocities. But something else was on their mind; the baby extracted from the womb.</p><p class=align-left>And the search ensued. Thanks to the Amber Alert system, police officers recovered Bobbi Jo Stinnett’s daughter. More than 15 years since the incident happened, Bobbie Joe Stinnett's daughter is grown up. Where is she today?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ac1f7219c9e3d697.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Are Laura Frizzo and Jeremy Ogden married? What you should know</span></p></a><h2>Who was Bobbie Jo Stinnett?</h2><p class=align-left>Bobbie Joe Stinnett was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dog breeder</a> that was murdered at the age of 23. She was looking forward to the birth of her first child.</p><p class=align-left>Bobbie was in love with Zeb Stinnett, Victoria's father and even had a dream of selling their small rental cottage for a new home to raise their child. But unfortunately, it never happened as everything was cut short when Bobbie was murdered, cut open, and her baby kidnapped.</p><h2>Bobbie and Lisa’s relationship</h2><p class=align-left>How did Lisa Montgomery and Victoria Jo Stinnett know each other? Bobbie, a graduate from Nodaway-Holt High School in Graham, Missouri, ran a dog <a href=#>business</a> with her husband from <a href=#>their home</a>. It is this business that brought the two together.</p><p class=align-left>They first interacted during a dog show event. After that, Lisa and Bobbie maintained contact through interacting online, mainly via an online Rat Terrier chatroom referred to as Ratter Chatter.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/217d70455ed12fe4.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Angie Marie Housman: What happened and where is Earl Cox?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>During their exchanges, Montgomery informed Bobbie that she was pregnant as well. They frequently exchanged emails about their pregnancies.</p><h2>What happened that fateful day?</h2><p class=align-left>It is hard to imagine what would have happened to Bobbie Jo Stinnett's baby if she had never been discovered. However, the murder that happened on that day is even more puzzling.</p><p class=align-left>Lisa communicated with Bobbie Jo and was already aware that she was pregnant. Also, she had lied to her that she was also pregnant.</p><p class=align-left>On that catastrophic day, in December 2004, Lisa drove to Bobbie's home in Missouri, purportedly to purchase a puppy. Instead, she <a href=#>attacked Bobbie </a>once she entered the house and strangled her until she lost consciousness.</p><p class=align-left>Then she proceeded to tear Bobbie's womb with a kitchen knife. The pain made Stinnett regain consciousness, causing a struggle. Lisa took further action to stop Bobbie's struggle, strangling her to death. She then extracted Bobbie's baby from her womb and kidnapped her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ffeb64753765ffa7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Donnah Winger murder case: What happened to convict Mark Winger?</span></p></a><h2>Victoria Stinnett was rescued a day later</h2><p class=align-left>An Amber Alert allowed police officers to locate Victoria Stinnett a day after being kidnapped. After discovering that the murdered victim had an unborn child missing, officials put an Amber Alert, not even sure if she was alive. They also had no clue what the baby looked like.</p><p class=align-left>Investigators located Lisa after someone responded to an Amber Alert. She was attempting to pass her off as her newborn baby. Also, Lisa Montgomery was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">faking a pregnancy</a> to friends and <a href=#>family</a>. In an interview with the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Associated Press</a>, Randy Strong, who was part of the squad looking for the baby, described the moment they found the infant as one of the most joyous.</p>As we walked across the threshold, our Amber Alert was scrolling across the TV at that very moment…I absolutely knew I was walking into the killer's home.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cdcdb09edb7f16c3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The story of Bernadette Protti: Everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The investigators got tips about Lisa hours after the murder and learnt that she had a history of faking pregnancies and suddenly had a child.</p><h2>Why did Lisa kidnap Victoria?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ac1f7219c9e3d697.jpg><p class=align-left>After the case made international news, everyone was likely wondering what the motive for the gruesome act was. In Lisa Montgomery's twisted mind, she thought she could pass the infant as hers, and you would be surprised at what pushed her to murder the mother. It's all about Lisa Montgomery's children.</p><p class=align-left>According to prosecutors, Lisa's ex-husband knew that she had undergone a tubal ligation that made her sterile. And since she was telling people that she was pregnant, he wanted to reveal she was falsifying her pregnancy to gain custody of their four children.</p><p class=align-left>And since she needed a child before her fast-approaching court date, she resorted to doing the heinous deed to prove that she was indeed pregnant and had delivered a beautiful baby.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8601c7c1939bc9ee.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Timothy Madden: Gabbi Doolin murder sentence and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, during the court proceedings, Lisa Montgomery's lawyers stated that she had a mental illness because of sexual abuse during childhood. Additionally, Lisa's father denied the sexual abuse claims.</p><p class=align-left>Montgomery confessed to the murder, and everything, including the knife and rope she used to strangle Bobbie, was found in her car. Also, police discovered that she researched how to perform a caesarean and how to order a birthing kit.</p><h2>Lisa’s murder trial and ruling</h2><p class=align-left>Lisa Montgomery was charged with kidnapping resulting in death. The crime was established by the Federal Kidnapping Act of 1932. And according to the title, anyone convicted of the crime faces a life sentence or the death penalty.</p><p class=align-left>On October 22, 2007, Lisa Montgomery was found guilty of the crime, and the jury recommended the death sentence. Judge Gary A. Fenner accepted the recommendation and gave Lisa the death sentence.</p><p class=align-left>She was scheduled to be executed via lethal injection on December 8. 2020 at the Terre Haute federal prison in Indiana, but it happened on January 13, 2021. Lisa was pronounced dead at 1:31 am EST.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/29f7f60421339144.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Mike Tyson's daughter?

But, the most exciting thing is that Victoria's family have shielded their daughter from the negative publicity over the years.
