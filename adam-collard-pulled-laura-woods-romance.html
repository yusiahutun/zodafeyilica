I’m from Newcastle and eventually we met up, and then went on a very undercover date, and obviously what comes out in the press, comes out in the press, but it’s not always the full story.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON ADAM COLLARD">READ MORE ON ADAM COLLARD</h2><p>"I’m kind of glad in a way as well, as I feel like there’s an element of having to hide too much now."</p><p>When asked if he used any smooth tactics to woo the blonde beauty, Adam replied: "I really like her, so I don’t want to jinx it."</p><p>Adam gushed over the <a href=#>TNT sports</a> host and said their relationship is getting more "serious".</p><p>He told us at The Best Heroes Awards: "I would never get in a relationship with someone at least at one point [unless] I thought they were The One.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Sport</h2></p><p>"Some of the 'girlfriends' I’ve had , and I’m saying 'girlfriends' because they’re not really girlfriends - they’re just girls I’ve been on one date with, and then suddenly they’re my girlfriend which puts a lot of pressure and stuff, because I would only say I’ve had three or four serious ones."</p><p>His blossoming new romance comes hot off the heels of his fling with model <a href=#>Lottie Moss</a>.</p><p>The pair enjoyed a brief dalliance while filming <a href=#>E4</a>'s <a href=#>Celebs Go Dating</a>.</p><p>The tattooed hunk said he's since moved on from Lottie after the pair cut communication.</p><p>He explained: "We haven’t really spoken.</p><p>"It’s one of those things, there was an element of real there, and there was an element of we had a really good excuse of seeing each other, because the TV crew were putting us in the same cars, and they were making me travel to London more.</p><p>"I had an excuse to go and see her because we were working together.</p><p>"I’m in Newcastle and I opened a gym the week of Celebs Go <span id=61e4422a-8278-4eb9-8756-a6bdb86edb84 class=suggested-link>Dating</span> starting, and I’ve got to be honest, I didn’t have time for anyone – let alone Lottie, and I am a very selfish person and especially with work.</p><p>"I feel coming off the show, which was probably the right time – not during that, because I did have a few big things that were happening in my life at that point."</p><p>When asked if he thought the the producers were pushing him and Lottie together, Adam said: "All I would say is how many people in offices end up getting with someone at work, and that is the best way I can relate it.</p><p>"I am still human and she is still human, and I would like to hope that if I saw her in person, we could give each other the benefit of the doubt and we’d be OK.</p><p>"But honestly the TV just amplifies everything, and I don’t want to bad mouth any of my relationships, but it is hard coming of Love Island and being in a relationship with someone because, you’re put into this bubble.</p><p>"Isn’t it funny how the ones who stick together, are people who have met from completely different things – for instance look how many times have you seen a presenter with someone else from a TV show?</p><p>"I think when it’s so close knit, it puts a lot of pressure, and it accelerates thing unnaturally."</p><p>Last week they were spotted on a&nbsp;<a href=#>romantic dog walk</a>&nbsp;in London.</p><p>The two held hands as Adam put his arm around casually-dressed Laura.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>It's after&nbsp;<a href=#>Laura posted her own snaps</a>&nbsp;with VERY intimate pictures of Adam in bed and on the sofa.</p><p>The Sun revealed Laura is Adam's
