He is currently starring on Netflix‚Äôs Sweet Magnolias. The actor has shared very little of his personal life. Here we talk about his age, wife, net worth, and more.</p><p>So, keep scrolling down to learn more about Dave.</p><h3><strong>Actor Dave MacDonald Plays Stu On Sweet Magnolias</strong></h3><p>The residents of South Carolina‚Äôs small-town Serenity are the subject of the Netflix series Sweet Magnolias, which follows them as they encounter challenges and reap the benefits of being part of a close-knit neighborhood. The Sweet Magnolias‚Äô lives are significantly altered by their local exploits after two seasons. Maddie (JoAnna Garcia Swisher) is embracing a heartfelt new relationship with Coach Cal Maddox (Justin Bruening) after getting over her ex-husband‚Äôs adultery and the scandal that accompanied it in the first season.</p><p>After deciding to move through with her ambitions to become a mother, Helen (Heather Headley) breaks up with her longstanding, on-again, off-again boyfriend Ryan (Michael Shenefelt) before committing to Erik (Dion Johnstone), who is prepared to help her while she pursues motherhood through IVF procedures. In the meantime, Dana Sue (Brooke Elliott) has made the decision to give her husband Ronnie (Brandon Quinn) another shot. However, this time, they are working with Pastor June (Tracey Bonner) to create a new beginning for both of them.</p><p>The third season of the show has only barely begun, but it is already a dumpster fire. We pick up with this character named Stu, who caused quite a commotion in the previous season. Stu didn‚Äôt appear until Season 2, Episode 8, but it now appears that he will play a significant role for some time.</p><p>Dave MacDonald‚Äôs character Stu serves as the naive beginning to everything. He first runs into Maddie and Cal at a black-tie charity function. Even sweeter, he beseeches Cal to sign a baseball card he owns. Cal is adored by Stu. Stu will always have a special place in his heart for Cal‚Äôs baseball career. One game, in particular, was more significant than the rest.</p><p>After Cal gets fired from his job as a Serenity High School baseball coach, Stu gets upset. At Sullivan‚Äôs, he runs into Cal and makes an effort to convey that he has Cal‚Äôs best interests at heart. His delivery, especially when defending someone he hardly knows, is a little bit too strong and emotive. Cal tries to comfort Stu after noticing how plainly distraught he is, but Stu only responds by wondering who he will have to fight.</p><p>‚ÄúPeople need to be talking about how we get you your job back. Hey, buddy. I‚Äôm trying to help you,‚Äù Stu pleads.&nbsp;Dana Sue is even forced to call the police as a result of the entire affair. Cal begins ejecting Stu forcibly before the police can arrive. The problem is that Cal was previously arrested for assault and battery.</p><p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre way over the line. A two-minute conversation doesn‚Äôt make us friends. I want you out of here now,‚Äù Cal tells Stu.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Actor Dave MacDonald Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Actor Dave MacDonald has been able to amass a net worth of $1 million.
