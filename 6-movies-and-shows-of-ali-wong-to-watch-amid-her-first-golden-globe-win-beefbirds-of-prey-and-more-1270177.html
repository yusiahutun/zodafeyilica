As a result, they get addicted to this beef, stretching this fight to dangerous extents. On the surface, it seems quite hilarious that two people would continue to have a beef with each other, both in damage and wits, over a fight that has virtually no consequence, no end product, and perhaps no resolution. However, that is the deepest commentary about humans being driven by hatred. Hatred is far stronger than other emotions, it is addictive and exciting.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Beef features a morally erroneous plot, excellent acting by the two leads, and well-paced storytelling. Despite some criticism of excess subplots, the series maintains a fun sound design and signature Netflix cinematography, making it a perfect TV show from Netflix in a long time.</p><h2 id=659c35131f1d9><strong>Ask the StoryBots</strong></h2><p>In one of Ali Wong's more family-friendly TV appearances, she plays The Brain in Ask the StoryBots.&nbsp;Wong's character, The Brain is very intimidating and regal with her Grecian gown, giant stature, and loud commanding voice. Suitably, for being a brain, she also gives a complex and accurate description of how ears hear. She is also quite proud and doesn't think much of her human, believing they should read more instead of playing video games.

Wong's character, Super Super Big Doctor is a dark reflection of Candace. She too has brothers who were treated better than her and feels like everything is against her, however, she takes things too far by imprisoning her brothers in a dungeon and planning to take over Earth with mind control. Wong's character is misleading as she pretends to be nice to Candace when in reality she wants to use Candace to restore her mind-controlling plant Mama with her carbon dioxide.

The film follows Harley Quinn, a baddie who moves on after a breakup with the Joker. Wong betrays Detective Renee Montoya's trust, leading to Montoya's suspension from the Gotham Police Department. This suspension spurs the plot and helps Quinn find her group. Wong's role in the Gotham universe is highly anticipated, and she is eagerly awaiting more future films featuring her.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=659c35131f1e8><strong>BoJack Horseman</strong></h2><p>Ali Wong played Maddy Ginsburg in BoJack Horseman, a beloved six-season show that received numerous accolades and was a hit with fans and audiences. Wong's character,&nbsp;Maddy Ginsburg is an irresponsible teenage girl who is an inadvertent victim of BoJack's well-meaning irresponsibility. Bojack's offer to buy her bourbon after he sees her with a Red Bull and vodka mixer causes her to become dangerously drunk during prom and leads to her needing to get her stomach pumped.
