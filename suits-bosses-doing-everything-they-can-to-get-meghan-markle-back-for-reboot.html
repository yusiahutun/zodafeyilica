During her seven-year stint on the law drama, she portrayed paralegal Rachel Zane. However, after her seventh series, she left Suits, and acting entirely, to marry <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> in 2018. The couple left The Firm in 2020 and moved to California. They live there with their two children, four-year-old Archie and Lilibet, two.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-159517843-scaled-e1706699050367-1024x551.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-could-return-to-suits-but-not-how-you-think>Meghan Markle could return to Suits … but not how you think</h2><p>A <a href=#>Hollywood</a> insider revealed to the Daily Express <a href=#>Suits</a> bosses have been trying to get Meghan Markle back involved in the reboot. They are said to be “prepared to pay what it takes to get her” on board.</p><p>There are even suggestions the Duchess of Sussex could make her directorial debut with the USA Network reboot, with her being behind the camera as well as in front of it.</p><p>The source <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “Meghan is in a commanding position. They want to expand a successful franchise in which she has a&nbsp;ready-made fan base of millions worldwide. They want her back, and they are prepared to pay what it takes to get her.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Meghan Markle returning to Hollywood with ‘Suits reunion isn’t going to happen’</a></p><p>The series, which the publication claims will be titled Suits: Los Angeles, has a female lead who resembles the <a href=#>royals</a> character Rachel Zane. The character was apparently “tailor-made” for her and a bio says she is “[in her] 30s, Black, SoCal native and Harvard Law alum. She’s jockeying to be made Head of Entertainment. She’s great at closing clients but struggles elsewhere. Smarter than everyone.”</p><p>The series has been green-lit and an official announcement from NBCUniversal is expected soon. Beatrice Springborn, who is a boss at Universal International Studios, said at an industry conference before Christmas the <a href=#>TV</a> show is being worked on “right now,” and she confirmed the reboot would be “in the same time frame” as the first nine seasons.</p><p>“Sure. Mike and Rachel in Seattle. They gotta come down to LA,” Patrick J. Adams, who played her onscreen husband Mike Ross said referencing where the onscreen couple wound up before Meghan left the series, “they gotta fix some stuff.”</p><p>“It is amazing looking people in great clothes, but at the core of it, you can’t have a show that’s successful with just that. It has to have great storytelling and great character work,” she said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-meghan-said-about-returning-to-hollywood>What has Meghan said about returning to Hollywood?</h2><p>Meghan hasn’t said much about returning to acting, let alone a Suits reboot. But she <a href=#>has hinted she could return</a> behind the scenes.</p><p>She previously said of the show after discovering its impressive <a href=#>Netflix</a> ratings: “It was a great show to work on, such a great cast and crew. We had a really fun time. I was on it for seven seasons, so quite a bit.”</p><p>In November, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> teased her return to making productions for the screen while on her red carpet for Variety’s Power of Women. She seemed to hint she wasn’t going to be in front of the camera this time, as she wanted “to make people feel something.”</p><p>“[I want to make] things that make people feel – I was going to say ‘good,’ but it’s more than that, things that make people feel something, right? And feel a sense of community,” she said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-psychic-predicts-meghan-will-have-a-career-comeback>Psychic predicts Meghan will have a career comeback</h2><p>Talking exclusively to Celebrity Tidbit before the Suits reboot news came out, psychic Adam Norton <a href=#>explained</a> he saw Meghan Markle returning to our screens.</p><p>However, he said there was a high chance she wouldn’t be acting and instead would be more likely to fill the role of director or producer instead.</p><p>He said: “I actually feel Meghan will return to work, so her career is about to take off in a different direction. I see some <a href=#>movie</a> and acting work ahead for her, so definitely expect to see her on the big screen.</p><p>“Both behind and in front of the camera, so there’s some acting work she’ll be doing, but also a little bit of directing and behind the scene action.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Harry and Meghan pose with ‘TV bosses’ weeks after rumors of Duchess’ ‘Hollywood comeback’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2h%2BcL%2FUoqusZZKkwLSx0mabqKGenHqmwsSrsK2gmaO0bsDHnrBmm5GjerW7jKCcrWWdmrSprc1mpJqqm6Gybq7AnKJmnp%2BnerOxwaimrWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsuits-bosses-doing-everything-they-can-to-get-meghan-markle-back-for-reboot.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsuits-bosses-doing-everything-they-can-to-get-meghan-markle-back-for-reboot.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsuits-bosses-doing-everything-they-can-to-get-meghan-markle-back-for-reboot.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsuits-bosses-doing-everything-they-can-to-get-meghan-markle-back-for-reboot.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsuits-bosses-doing-everything-they-can-to-get-meghan-markle-back-for-reboot.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsuits-bosses-doing-everything-they-can-to-get-meghan-markle-back-for-reboot.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./teddy-campbell.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./teddy-campbell.html>Teddy Campbell</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-movie-review-tom-cruise-impresses-hugely-entertaining.html>Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One movie review: Tom Cruise impresses in hugely enterta</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-movie-review-tom-cruise-impresses-hugely-entertaining.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
