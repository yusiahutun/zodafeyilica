The best accolades are always brief, specific as well as thoughtful and have an occasional feel of humour. Below is a step by step guide that will show you how to go about writing a tribute. We have included some examples to help you grasp the concept better in spite of being in grief.</p><h2>What is a tribute?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fa51becc7f79a536.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 books that make you think about love in a different way</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is writing done in admiration of someone often to show them respect and regard by indicating his/her achievements. For example, you can pay tribute to the Kenya Army for protecting the country from Jihadist attacks.</p><p class=align-left>Tributes can be given on various occasions. However, they are more common at funerals. It is a misconception that they are meant for sharing the characters and experiences or contributions of a deceased person. These letters are acceptable if the subject is alive.</p><p class=align-left>Accolades often have the following characteristics irrespective of whether the focus is on a group or an individual:</p><ul><li>Respect and admiration.</li><li>A focus on only positive qualities such as dedication, perseverance, humility, trustworthiness, kindness, humour, honesty, loyalty, sacrifice, and so on.</li><li>Highlights of accomplishments and the many difficulties one had to overcome to achieve them.</li><li>Reflection of the impact of the person on other people’s lives.</li><li>An acknowledgment of only the good things you learnt from them.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9673449af3e43ff7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Celebration of life program ideas and templates</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to write articles in few easy steps</p><h2>What occasions call for a tribute?</h2><p class=align-left>You can deliver a tribute in any of the following events:</p><ul><li><strong>Anniversaries: </strong>These include family events such as a wedding anniversary, birthday or historic days such as the Mashujaa Day.</li><li><strong>Funerals or memorial tribute: </strong>The eulogy you time and again hear in all the burials are a type of commemorative tribute speech done to celebrate the life of a deceased individual.</li><li><strong>Awards:</strong> When presenting an award to someone, you can honour him/her by giving out this type of speech.</li><li><strong>Weddings: </strong>Although most people think that this is a wedding speech, it is a type of accolade.</li><li><strong>Retirements: </strong>These honour the retiree by acknowledging some of his achievements and service contributions.</li></ul><h2>Structure of a tribute speech</h2><p class=align-left>A good structure gives a well organised and comprehended expression when paying tribute to someone. The following should be included:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/91eb86fc22cebbe4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Famous South African proverbs and sayings</span></p></a><ul><li><strong>Introduction</strong>: Introduce yourself and tell the audience who you are to the person you are dedicating your speech.</li><li><strong>Background:</strong> Explains why you decided to write the accolade.

How do you go about penning it down from the start to the conclusion? Below is a step by step guide on how to write a tribute to a person who is alive or dead:</p><h3>Assemble all the necessary materials</h3><p class=align-left>You might need a pen, a paper or if you are typing, a computer/laptop and a notebook. You can also grab a cup of coffee to keep your mind awake as you compose the speech.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/455fe000bb69400a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful and motivating Islamic quotes about life with images</span></p></a><h3>Decide on the accolade tone</h3><p class=align-left>How serious and light-hearted do you want your tribute to be? If you are writing a eulogy, then you have no choice but to make it uniformly and just appropriate. You can also pick a saddening approach or be bold and add some humour. When used cautiously, especially in a tribute to a dead person, wittiness can help convey the real personality of the departed while illustrating some endearing qualities he/she had.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fa51becc7f79a536.png><p class=align-left>The tone will be entirely determined by the type of accolade you are writing. For instance, if you are giving a wedding tribute, then the speech would be less serious. Also, if you are writing a eulogy of a small child who died untimely, the tone would be saddening compared to that of a grandma who lived happily to see her hundred and five birthdays.</p><h3>Consider your audience</h3><p class=align-left>You should write your speech with its purpose in mind. Be honest and dwell on the positive only. Avoid talking about negativity at all costs. Alternatively, you might elude it gently like, “You two have been through various misunderstandings, to which you solved amicably.” Just make sure you don’t utter anything that will offend, confuse or shock the subject and audience.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b4802e451c27a66.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best motivational speeches for students</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For example, if you are writing a tribute to a deceased person, don’t include sections that will be mysterious to the crowd.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to write a report (with samples)</p><h3>Introduce yourself briefly</h3><p class=align-left>Even if all the people in the crowd know you, it is vital to introduce yourself. Mention how you are related to the subject who might be alive or dead. If you aren’t close, then say a few words about how and when you came to know the subject.</p><h3>Give out the necessary information about the subject</h3><p class=align-left>Your tribute doesn’t have to be like an obituary or a eulogy if the person is alive. Only touch on very few vital points about the subject’s family life, career, achievements, hobbies, and some interests that matter/mattered to him/her. Find a way of mentioning all this information as you praise the subject.</p><p class=align-left>If you are composing a eulogy, then it is advisable to include some names of the deceased’s family members especially those who were close. Have them in hand as you might forget them on a funeral day as a result of being overwhelmed by sadness.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/483d2a0fabbe8d87.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 best and meaningful tattoo ideas for men</span></p></a><h3>Use real examples to describe the subject</h3><p class=align-left>Don’t recite a long list of qualities that the person in question has. Instead, have an illustration using a story for each of them. To get more memories, impressions and thoughts about the subject, talk to as many people as you can and then write what you obtain as your own.</p><p class=align-left>If the person in question is deceased, look for a conjoint theme that unites every idea you have. Try to illustrate them through stories. For instance:</p><ul><li>If the subject was kind, talk about a specific time, he helped a sick person get back on his feet.</li><li>If he was a known prankster, you should mention one of his best April fool’s day prank.</li></ul><p class=align-left>The examples above also apply if you want to write a tribute to a person when he is alive. You have to restructure them to fit your illustrations and ideas.</p><p class=align-left>In a nutshell, pretend that a person who is a stranger to the subject is listening to you. From your speech, would he/she get an excellent sense of the person you have been describing from your words without having to meet him in person?</p><h3>Be organised and concise</h3><p class=align-left>Outline the parts of your speech before you start penning it down. Also, brainstorm all the areas such as interests, biography, personal traits and characters. Write them down in a point form so you can remember each of them quickly as you compose the speech. When writing, cover each area with a systematic order. Give your address a beginning, middle and also end. Avoid conversely or rambling speaking to the audience. You might think of including a sterling vocabulary, but dump it for the masses this once.</p><p class=align-left>An average tribute speech lasts between 3 to 5 minutes. So, make sure you can give an essential oration about the subject in the time bracket. Remember that the longer it is, the more you are testing the patience of the crowd during the event, especially if it’s a funeral.</p><h3>Get feedback</h3><p class=align-left>Once you are through with writing the tribute, get some friends or family members who know the subject to read it through. They will make sure that it is not only appropriate and accurate but also captures the essence of the deceased. They will also be able to tell if you have written something confusing or ambiguous to understand.</p><p class=align-left>Tell them to help you remove repetitive phases and edit minor mistakes. However, your grammar doesn’t have to be on point as it won’t be published anywhere and also no one will read it.</p><h3>Rehearse the accolade</h3><p class=align-left>Read your tribute aloud. If you have time, read it with someone as you practice. Words often sound very different when read aloud compared to when on paper.</p><p class=align-left>If you have included some humour in your speech, let your friend give you feedback about its effectiveness and appropriateness after listening.</p><p class=align-left>Remember that inscribing is 90% rewriting so be prepared to correct some mistakes several times to make your accolade shinier.</p><h2>Tribute speech examples</h2><p class=align-left>Below are some moving accolades that demonstrate how hope, beauty, and inspiration can grow from happy moments or grief.</p><h3>Retirement tribute speech</h3><i>When Engineer Rantich Kipkoech esquire joined the JMTKD Company, black and white TV sets had just arrived in Kenya. KBC’s Vioja Mahakamani and WWE Wrestling were top of the charts in the country. </i><i>When we look at JMTKD’s history, different people featured in various prominent ways. Dr Tesla, the founder, Kepler, the award-winning inventor and Mark Otieno, who saw the potential of upgrading our systems. But the 1970s belonged to Engineer Rantich Kipkoech, and it is my pleasure to pay tribute to his era. Everyone in this room, including new and the longest-serving employee, has contributed significantly to the success of JMTKD. However, our talk is dedicated to Engineer Rantich.</i><p class=align-left><i>Rantich steered this company through assisting in the plant’s manufacturing processes since his early days. In 1980, he was appointed the chief engineer, and over the 30 years, he would oversee all the control processes in the factory. His reign saw implementations of significant developments that increased the output of our commodities.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>Engineer Rantich was fair, principled, firm and consistent. If you got a telling off from him, it is most likely that you deserved it, and once said it was over and done.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>He was also excellent in encouraging initiative, innovation and teamwork. The company had a tremendous production during the 1990s to around 2010.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>He was a great delegator and listener. It was as if he adhered to the adage, “The best way to keep power is to share it, and the best way to influence is to listen.”</i></p><p class=align-left><i>Rantich did not have any engineering philosophy that I could have discerned. He just concentrated on getting right the basics.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>Using our talents and leaving an unforgettable legacy is something that we will all desire to do. Rantich has succeeded in doing this right. One thing I have heard some employees say is that he is essentially the same person who joined our company those years.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>JMTKD is now a better place because of Rantich’s efforts. Let’s hope that we will all say that when our retirement time comes.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>My final accolade is to say that I believe we can face the future under Kamau (his successor) as Rantich has laid a strong foundation. I call my toast, “The best is yet to come.”</i></p><p class=align-left><i>Enjoy your hobbies such as golf, travelling, hill climbing and any other activity that turns you on as you retire.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>You are retiring from the company, but there is a new world of leisure, business, and many voluntary activities waiting for you. Hundreds of companies will value your control and instrumentation skills.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>I know you were prepared for this transition as you have been seeing a retirement coach for the last two years.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>Rantich, I am reminded of Horace the Roman poet’s words….</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“You played more than enough, you ate and drank sufficiently, now it’s time to depart.”</i></p><p class=align-left><i>Congratulations on such an incredible engineering career and all the best as you enter the next phase of life. It has been our pleasure to work with someone like you.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>To yourself, children and Jane, I wish you a long life, happiness together, and health.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9673449af3e43ff7.jpg><h3>A funeral tribute</h3><p class=align-left><i>My mother, Margret Kwamboka Mutuku, was born on February 12 1910, in Kileleshwa, Nairobi. She was one of the twelve children, six girls and six boys, born to my grandpa, Mutuku Sammy Mutua and Grandma, Priscah Mwende Mutuku.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>My mother has a total of three children, my brother Bryan, my sister Prudence and I am the baby, Martin.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>So, all of you who knew my mother know that she was very loving, sweet, kind, generous, caring, and humble. Sometimes I wish half of us could be as friendly and selfless as she was.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>She was so caring and hardly worried about life. She was very non-judgemental. She just accepted everyone no matter what they did and who they were. She loved everyone from the family, friends to neighbours. She always made some few friends wherever she went.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>I remember asking her if she was afraid of dying before she passed away. My mother’s answer was a no without even a skip of her heart. She said that she wasn’t scared of dying because she knew that God was waiting for her.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>She added and made it clear that she didn’t want to leave her family and children behind!</i></p><p class=align-left><i>I told her not to worry as we will be alright and we will help each other in the best way she taught us.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>My mom lit up a room whenever she went, and now she is undoubtedly lighting up heaven with her beautiful smile and laugh. She is busy lighting up our daily paths as we walk. Mom is making us know that she is okay and that she is in heaven. She also wants us to adore each other and treat others with the respect they deserve.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>So, before I finish this, I want to thank all of you who showed up for this beautiful yet beautiful occasion for remembering all the good memories you shared with her and how she changed lives with her everlasting love!</i></p><p class=align-left>The procedure on how to write a tribute to someone alive or deceased is that simple. Remember to relax and use a conversational tone when giving out the speech. Read the piece as if you are talking to your friends. Pause, and go slow as you wish. If you are in grief, have a backup plan for someone to read it in your place just in case you become too emotional to deliver it.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to write a project proposal?</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkWlnb29dnby4edaroK2dXZZ6tb7Im6ytnV2axaK5z6WcrGaYqbqt</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f320067-how-write-a-tribute-examples-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f320067-how-write-a-tribute-examples-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f320067-how-write-a-tribute-examples-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f320067-how-write-a-tribute-examples-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f320067-how-write-a-tribute-examples-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f320067-how-write-a-tribute-examples-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mlb-baseball-news-ive-always-been-a-fan-of-her-despite-their-bitter-feud-jennifer-lopez-couldnt-resist-mariah-careys-hit-single-inspired-by-derek-jeter.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mlb-baseball-news-ive-always-been-a-fan-of-her-despite-their-bitter-feud-jennifer-lopez-couldnt-resist-mariah-careys-hit-single-inspired-by-derek-jeter.html>Ive Always Been a Fan of Her Despite Their Bitter Feud, Jennifer LopezCouldnt Resis</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./best-wedding-shoes-brands.html>Best places to buy wedding shoes - with expert buying advice</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./best-wedding-shoes-brands.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
