<time>04 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Kenya Summer Moore is a popular television personality who has also dabbled in acting, producing, writing, and entrepreneurship.</p><p>In recent years, Moore is perhaps best known for her role in the reality series, The Real Housewives of Atlanta, which is the most consistently highly rated reality program not just of that ilk but in general. However, Moore gained prominence after winning the Miss USA contest of 1993 and then placing in the top six of the same year’s Miss Universe pageant.</p><p>She made history in the pageant as only the second black woman to be crowned Miss USA after 1990’s Carole Gist and holds the unique distinction of being the first dark-skinned woman to win the pageant.</p><p>After her win, she began to appear in many films and television shows, with the most popular ones being the romance film Waiting To Exhale in 1995, The Steve Harvey Show in 1998, the romantic comedy film Deliver Us From Eva in 2003, and the CW’s Girlfriends in 2004.</p><p>In more recent years, Moore has found success behind the screen as she did in front of hit, and not only has she produced several film projects, authored a book, and starred in her exercise video. Her most successful venture was the hair care brand she founded, Moore Hair.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=theres-so-much-more-to-know-about-kenya-moore></span>There’s So Much More To Know About Kenya Moore<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tbody><tr><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Television Personality</td></tr><tr><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Jehovah’s Witness</td></tr><tr><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5 feet 10 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Miss USA 1993</td></tr><tr><td>1992 – Present</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-kenya-moores-religion-and-ethnicity></span>What Is Kenya Moore’s Religion And Ethnicity?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kenya Moore is a Jehovah’s Witness of African American ethnicity, and she has commented on how strange people find that.</p><p>She revealed her religion in the season 8 finale of The Real Housewives of Atlanta. She mentioned that she was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness, which is why she does not celebrate holidays. However, she also stated that although she was raised in the religion and went door-to-door distributing religious literature, which the Jehovah’s Witness is famous for, Moore was never baptized.</p><p>Although she identifies as a Jehovah’s Witness, Moore has stated that she is not too strict with it, as her lack of a baptism shows; however, she is choosing to raise her daughter as a Jehovah’s witness.</p><p>Moore’s ethnicity and identity as an African-American, especially a dark-skinned one, have always been part of the conversation surrounding her. From colorist remarks about her to people celebrating her skin, Moore has seen both sides of the spectrum talk about and react to her.</p><p>Read about another Real Housewives star:&nbsp;Is Jen Shah Accused Guilty Or Innocent? All We Know About The ‘Real Housewives’ Star</p><p>Her dark-skinned-ness is what set her apart from all the candidates back in 1993, and it still makes her uniquely her. But Moore has only found beauty and strength in her dark skin and continues to spread that message through her social media and various enterprises.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-kenya-moores-husband-a-look-into-the-real-housewife-of-atlantas-relationships></span>Who Is Kenya Moore’s Husband? A Look Into The Real Housewife Of Atlanta’s Relationships<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kenya Mooer has had a turbulent dating history as her most recent relationship has ended bitterly.</p><p>From 2017 to 2021, Moore married her husband, businessman and New York Restaurant owner Marc Daly. They had been dating since 2016, and a year into their marriage, in November 2018, Moore gave birth to their first child, Brooklyn, named after Marc and Moore first met.</p><p>However, the marriage would suffer just a year later, and the couple would separate in 2019, with Moore filing for divorce in August 2021. Daly isn’t Moore’s most controversial relationship, as that distinction goes to her boyfriend before Daly, Atlanta-based personal trainer Matt Jordan, who appeared with Moore for much of the Real Housewives of Atlanta’s eighth season.</p><p>The couple dated from mid-205 to mid-2016, and their relationship was very rocky for the most part. Jordan was a very violent man who regularly had outbursts, which led to their break up and a 1-year restraining order from Moore for the year 2017.</p><p>Besides the relationships mentioned above, Moore has been linked to various personalities such as NFL wide receiver Terrell Owens back in 2014, her co-star in season 7 of Celebrity Apprentice; NBA legend Allen Iverson, who she was rumored to have dated in the 1990s’ Mike Tyson, and even Ludacris, although the exact timeline of the latter two is not publicly known.</p><p>Still, besides Daly and Jordan, Moore has not made any mentions of the other men in her life, and as such, it is entirely up to public speculation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-kenya-moores-parents-does-she-have-a-bad-relationship-with-her-mother></span>Who Are Kenya Moore’s Parents? Does She Have A Bad Relationship With Her Mother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kenya Moore was born in Detroit to her parents, two teenagers, Patricia Moore and Ronald Grant.</p><p>Due to her parents’ youth, Moore was raised by her paternal grandmother Doris Grant, and an aunt. The reason behind this is also because Moore’s mother abandoned her at three days old.</p><p>Moore still has a tense and almost nonexistent relationship with her mother, who she states never acknowledged her and still does not. However, her grandmother was raised with much love, to the point that Moore’s daughter’s middle name, Doris, is after her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions></span>Frequently Asked Questions<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>What is the name of Kenya Moore’s book?<ul><li>Kenya Moore’s book is named “Game, Get Some!: What Women Really Want.”</li></ul></li><li>Has Kenya Moore ever been in a music video?<ul><li>Yes, she was famously in Jermaine Dupri’s Money Ain’t Got a Thang and has been in many more videos.</li></ul></li><li>How tall is Kenya Moore?<ul><li>She is five feet and 10 inches.</li></ul></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutdJmqaGnkWK4prrYmmSmp5%2BnsrR50Z6jop%2BZpLturc2dZJ6smKO2pLXTsmSlnZGnu26twaisrWWknbJurcKtqZ6ro2J%2FcHiLZWNlZFw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-rhoa-kenya-moores-religion-and-ethnicity-learn-about-the-actress-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-rhoa-kenya-moores-religion-and-ethnicity-learn-about-the-actress-2.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-rhoa-kenya-moores-religion-and-ethnicity-learn-about-the-actress-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-rhoa-kenya-moores-religion-and-ethnicity-learn-about-the-actress-2.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-rhoa-kenya-moores-religion-and-ethnicity-learn-about-the-actress-2.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-rhoa-kenya-moores-religion-and-ethnicity-learn-about-the-actress-2.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-trench-coats-for-women.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-trench-coats-for-women.html>15 Best Trench Coats for Women to Wear in 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./best-shapewear.html>The 21 Best Shapewear of 2024, Tested and Reviewed</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./best-shapewear.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
