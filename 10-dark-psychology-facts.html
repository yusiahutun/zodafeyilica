This insidious form of manipulation can lead to self-doubt and dependency on the manipulator.</p><p>Social Proof:</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-9>Fact: People tend to conform and follow the actions or beliefs of a majority or influential group.</h2><p>Humans possess a strong instinct to conform to the behavior and beliefs of others in order to fit in and avoid social rejection.
