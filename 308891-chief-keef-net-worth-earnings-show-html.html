He dropped out of school aged fifteen to pursue his career as a rapper, but wouldn't imagine that he would one day glide in the industry and succeed. To this date, Keef has released three studio albums and has done many collabos with big names in the industry. But just how much does chief Keef make? As you will see, his net worth is a cumulative sum of the earnings from music sales, tours and shows.</p><h2>Chief Keef net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Chief Keef is a new name in the industry, drawing attention from all spheres of the globe. Fans have nicknamed him the "black Justin Bieber" because of his ability to appeal to the youngsters in the black community.

Well, his earnings just like for all other celebrities, depends on the popularity at the time. By 2013 when he was at the apex of his career, Keef was making $85k per show.

However, following the controversies surrounding his career at the time, he was kicked out of the house and moved to Los Angeles where he lives to date. In his Instagram, Keef has lavishly portrayed his lifestyle characterized by photos of the high-end estate.</p><p class=align-left>The homestead has a private swimming pool, a hot tub, and a private compound. Although fans were worried when he was kicked out of the Highland Park mansion for failing to pay his accumulated rent, Keef has rubbished the claims of his bankruptcy. He claims that the new house is a more upgraded and an expensive lifestyle compared to his previous setting.</p><h2>Chief Keef cars</h2><p class=align-left>Apart from the lavish dwellings what does Chief Keef drive? The star has been pictured on numerous occasions driving high-end luxurious rides. However, it's difficult to ascertain whether or not he owns them following a court response that he rents most of his rides. In response to the court, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he stated</a> "No your honour, that $100K Lambo isn't an asset, I'm only renting it!" However, coupled with the rental cars, he owns a BMW i8 and two BMW M6s, cumulatively valued at $500k. It is a significant step up for the star, given the rocky upbringing he endured in high school living with his grandma.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0bf4342c17f2a948.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How did Flip from Street Outlaws die?
