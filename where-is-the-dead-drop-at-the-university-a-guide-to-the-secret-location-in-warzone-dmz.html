One of the missions that players can encounter is called Icebreaker, which requires them to find a dead drop at the university and deliver a letter of introduction. But where is the dead drop at the university? And how can players complete this mission successfully? In this article, we will answer these questions and more. ## What is a Dead Drop? According to Wikipedia[^1^][1], a dead drop is a term used to describe a hidden location where items or information can be exchanged without direct contact between the parties involved. In Warzone DMZ, dead drops are used by the different factions that are fighting for control of Vondel, such as the Phalanx, the Black Mous, and the Saviors. Dead drops are usually marked by white dumpsters that have a special symbol on them. Players can interact with these dumpsters to retrieve or deposit items that are related to their missions. ## Where is the Dead Drop at the University? The dead drop at the university is one of the objectives of the Icebreaker mission, which is given by the Black Mous faction. To start this mission, players have to go to the Vondel Zoo, which is located in the southwest of the map, and find another dead drop there. From this dead drop, players have to pick up a letter of introduction and a tracker, which will lead them to the university dead drop. However, the tricky part is that the university dead drop is not actually located at the university point of interest, which is in the north of the map. Instead, it is located in an unmarked area nearby, across the canal, next to a gas station. The exact location of the university dead drop is in map grid G3, behind the gas station building, next to a dumpster. The image below shows the location of the university dead drop, as well as the symbol that players have to look for. ![University Dead Drop Location](https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/where-to-find-the-vondel-university-dead-drop-in-dmz) ## How to Complete the Icebreaker Mission? To complete the Icebreaker mission, players have to follow these steps: - Go to the Vondel Zoo and find the dead drop there. It is located in map grid C6, near the entrance of the zoo, next to a dumpster. The image below shows the location of the zoo dead drop, as well as the symbol that players have to look for. ![Zoo Dead Drop Location](https://twinfinite.net/call-of-duty/where-to-find-the-vondel-university-dead-drops-in-warzone-dmz/) - Interact with the zoo dead drop and pick up the letter of introduction and the tracker. The tracker will show the direction and the distance to the university dead drop on the screen. - Go to the university dead drop and interact with it. Deposit the letter of introduction and the tracker in the dumpster. - Go to the nearest exfil point and escape from the map. The exfil points are marked by green flares on the map. Players have to reach the exfil point and wait for a helicopter to arrive. However, players have to be careful, as other players and enemies can also see the exfil points and try to stop them. ## Tips and Tricks for the Icebreaker Mission Here are some tips and tricks that can help players complete the Icebreaker mission more easily and efficiently: - Use a vehicle to travel faster and avoid enemies. There are several vehicles scattered around the map, such as cars, bikes, and trucks. Players can use these vehicles to move from one point to another, as well as to run over enemies or escape from them. However, players have to be aware that vehicles make noise and can attract attention, so they have to be careful when driving near enemy outposts or hotspots. - Avoid unnecessary fights and stay stealthy. The Icebreaker mission is not about killing enemies, but about delivering the letter of introduction. Therefore, players should avoid engaging in unnecessary fights and stay stealthy as much as possible. Players can use suppressors, silencers, or stealth perks to reduce their noise and visibility, as well as to avoid detection by enemy UAVs or radars. Players can also use smoke grenades, flashbangs, or stun grenades to distract or blind enemies, as well as to cover their movements or escapes. - Use the UAV towers to locate the dead drops and the exfil points. The UAV towers are tall structures that can be activated by players to reveal the locations of the dead drops and the exfil points on the map. There are two UAV towers near the university area, one in map grid F3 and one in map grid H3. Players can use these UAV towers to find the exact locations of the dead drops and the exfil points, as well as to see the positions of other players and enemies. However, players have to be careful, as activating the UAV towers will also alert other players and enemies to their presence, so they have to be ready for a fight or a quick getaway. - Team up with other players and share the loot. The Icebreaker mission can be done solo or in a team. Teaming up with other players can make the mission easier and faster, as players can share the loot, cover each other, and coordinate their actions. However, players have to be careful, as not all players are friendly and some may betray or kill them for their loot. Therefore, players should only team up with players they trust or communicate with, and be wary of strangers or enemies. ## Conclusion The Icebreaker mission is one of the many missions that players can encounter in Warzone DMZ, the new game mode in Warzone Season 4. The mission requires players to find a dead drop at the university and deliver a letter of introduction. However, the dead drop is not actually at the university, but in an unmarked area nearby, across the canal, next to a gas station. Players have to use the tracker to find the dead drop, deposit the letter of introduction, and then go to the nearest exfil point and escape from the map. The mission can be challenging and rewarding, as players have to face enemies, loot, and survive in the Vondel map. The mission also offers a glimpse into the lore and the factions of Warzone DMZ, as well as the secrets and mysteries of the city of Amsterdam. </code></pre><p>I hope you like the article I wrote for you.
