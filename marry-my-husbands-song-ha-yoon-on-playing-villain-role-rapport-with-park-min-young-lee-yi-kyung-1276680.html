Song Ha Yoon further reveals the kind of roles she would take after Marry My Husband. Read the full interview below.</p><p><strong>What are some differences you noticed while working on Marry My Husband compared to its webtoon?</strong></p><p>While analyzing the character, I looked up the original Marry My Husband. In the drama, Jeong Soomin is three-dimensional as the narrative progresses, so I tried to keep her acting as simple as possible to capture the feel of the original, and her three-dimensionality in the drama to stand out through styling.</p><p><strong>Playing a character that people are bound to dislike is a tough choice. Why did you decide to accept the role of Jeong Soomin and what would you like to say to viewers about her?</strong></p><p>I've been playing a lot of good roles, so I longed for a new character, then I came across the script for Marry My Husband, which was really interesting. Jeong Soomin is a realistic character who can be seen in our academic and social lives, so I think viewers can relate to her more. Also, Jeong Soomin has many different faces, from lovely to provocative.</p><p>So I thought I could use my existing good image to my advantage, and I was able to challenge myself with a role where the sense of betrayal is felt more because she is familiar. So I thought I could use the existing good image to my advantage, and I was able to challenge myself with Jeong Soomin, a role whose betrayal is felt more because it was familiar.</p><p><img alt="Song Ha Yoon: courtesy of Studio Dragon" title="Song Ha Yoon: courtesy of Studio Dragon" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-02/1707226097_song-ha-yoon-2.jpg></p><p><strong>What do you think Jeong Soomin would change if she was sent to the past instead of Yang Jiwon? What would you personally do differently if you were sent instead?</strong></p><p>Jeong Soomin would do the same thing even if she could go back in time. She is a character with many deficiencies, so I personally hope that she overcomes them and makes wise choices to stay healthy.</p><p><strong>What is your off-screen chemistry like with Park Min Young and Lee Yi Kyung? Do you think Jeong Soomin and Park Minhwan are best for each other?</strong></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Marry My Husband has a special meaning for all the actors, so they prepared hard and acted as if they were the characters themselves. Jeong Soomin is a character who doesn't know much about love, so I think she's been struggling with herself from the past, so I think she's best suited to be alone</p><p><strong>What roles are you aiming for in your acting career and what kind of story would you like to take on next?</strong></p><p>I'd love to do a comedy, a really sad movie that makes people's emotions explode, or a genius or hacker character who can easily work with astronomical numbers.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#
