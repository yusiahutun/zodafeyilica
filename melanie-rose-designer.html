<time>11 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Melanie Rose is famously gaining the limelight after she has been exposed by the new Netflix series “How to Build a S*x Room” as its host. She is the lady who designs rooms and develops passionate spaces for loving partners wishing them to rekindle. Netflix is now starting investing in home and design content, hosting shows like Dream Home Makeover and Interior Design Masters. Also, Netflix has never hosted such shows which particularly specify the niche “s*x”.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Melanie Rose is around 57 years old and is now being watched or explored with the help of the new Netflix series “How to Build a S*x Room”. It is known that Melanie left her house in 2000 and thereby started exploring things in other states and countries. Currently, she is based in Los Angeles, California. On her social media, she posts things about the trend of tea in British homes and her love for gardening which gives her a soothing effect and acts as the best therapy to her.</p><h3>Melanie Rose Career</h3><p>Melanie who is nowadays getting famous because of the Netflix new series did not directly start with the particular niche and started designing rooms for loving couples or partners. Indeed, she is an interior designer who belongs to Surrey, England, and was at a time famous for specializing in luxury bathrooms, and kitchen designs. She began designing the s*x rooms about a decade ago at the request of a client. At the Netflix press event, Rose appeared to narrate her story herself and said that she was once approached by a client who asked her if she had designed a s*x room before. During the time, she was a bit confused about the topic and was shocked if such things even exist.</p><p>She was hesitant during the time and after making some research, she thought why not, and why would not she start designing the s*x rooms. The rest remains history. In reality, she was famous for the making of Faucets, fixtures, cabinets, and more are the archetypal elements for kitchens and bathroom sets. She says that there is not much scope for creativity. Conversely, she says that designing s*x rooms gave Rose several opportunities to go beyond the “box” and come up with new ideas. She has been exploring her niche with a shining future for more than 10 years now.</p><h4>How to Build a S*x Room</h4><p>Melanie also stated that he initially had to sign NDAs while working for clients who generally belonged to high-profile statuses. She says that although these clients do not appear on Netflix, they do discuss the specific details of making their favorite creations with her. Melanie also says that she has made the rooms padded walls, and adorned with lovable things. She says that any room can be transferred into a s*x room or spae almost like a fantasy room or the room that gives passion to your experiences.</p><p>Melanie also brings the collection of her s*x toys and the bag full of tricks. She says that she used to display all the things that can bring comfort to the levels of the clients, boundaries, and their preferences. The things that she brings to the room help her design the spaces better. She says that the confinement of the s*x toys breaks the ice with the clients and makes clients open up about their choices or demands or talk about their fantasies. Even her British accent [that combines with the accent of “pish-posh”] makes the clients think that they can talk about anything or everything to her, giving a feeling of comfort to them.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Melanie Rose (Designer) Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Melanie Rose</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>1965</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2022)</td><td>57 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>London, England</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Host, Designer</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 8” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 172 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 65 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 143 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Melanie-Rose-2.jpg alt width=960 height=721 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Divorced</td></tr><tr><td>Who is her husband?</td><td>Adam Gascoine</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>It is known that Melanie Rose is single for now, however, she was previously married and divorced.
