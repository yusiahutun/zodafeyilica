And a significant part of my day today will be spent filing police reports at home about gender violence that’s directed at me in social media.” <strong>– Ashley Judd</strong></p><p>“The way things happen on social media is so abusive, and everyone needs to take personal responsibility for what they write and not allowing this misinterpretation and shaming culture on social media to persist.” <strong>– Ashley Judd</strong></p><p>“Patriarchy is not men. Patriarchy is a system in which both women and men participate. It privileges, inter alia, the interests of boys and men over the bodily integrity, autonomy, and dignity of girls and women. It is subtle, insidious, and never more dangerous than when women passionately deny that they themselves are engaging in it.” <strong>– Ashley Judd</strong></p><p>“When I allow myself to feel all my feelings instead of numbing myself to them, they pass more quickly. I spent my entire life telling everyone I was “OK, damn it.” But when you surrender to the [uncomfortable] feelings, there are gifts on the other side: Allowing yourself to feel loneliness forces you to reach out.” <strong>–&nbsp;Ashley Judd</strong></p><p>“Tough girls come from New York. Sweet girls, they’re from Georgia. But for us Kentucky girls, we have fire and ice in our blood. We can ride horses, be debutantes, throw left hooks, and drink with the boys, all the while making sweet tea, darling. And if we have an opinion, you know you’re gonna hear it.” <strong>– Ashley Judd</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=3-powerful-lessons-from-ashley-judd></span>3 Powerful Lessons from Ashley Judd&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Now that you know all about Ashley Judd’s net worth and how she achieved success; let’s take a look at some of the lessons we can learn from her:&nbsp;</p><h3>1.
