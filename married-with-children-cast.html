Unlike the picture-perfect families on shows like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Family Ties</a>, The Cosby Show, and <a href=#>Growing Pains</a>, the Bundy crew was dysfunctional, sarcastic and always bickering. Yet the show stayed on the air for eleven seasons, making it one of the longest-running sitcoms in history thanks to its shock-value humor (spoiler alert: not all of the jokes aged well) and the comedic chemistry among the Married… with Children cast. Here are some surprising facts you may not have known about the talented cast and what they’re up to now. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/GettyImages-1139747878-edited.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ed O’Neill as Al Bundy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Copy-of-then-and-now.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ed O’Neill</a> was pursuing a career as a stage actor when he was offered the role of the Bundy family patriarch, a bitter Chicago shoe salesman who spends his time loafing on the couch and reminiscing about his glory days as a high school football player.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>O’Neill’s agent wanted him to focus on more serious roles instead, but he couldn’t pass up the opportunity —&nbsp;or the steady paycheck. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">By the eighth season, I was the highest-paid actor on television</a>, making almost a million dollars a show,” he told Wealthsimple Magazine in 2021.</p><p>After Married… with Children ended, O’Neill appeared in a handful of movies before landing the role of Jay Pritchett on the TV series Modern Family (2009-2020), which earned him three Emmy nods and four Screen Actors Guild Awards. O’Neill also lent his voice to the animated movies Wreck-It Ralph (2012) and Finding Dory (2016), and in 2023, he starred in the miniseries The Sterling Affairs.</p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p><p>Like Al Bundy, O’Neill is a former football star! He played defense for Ohio University and was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers. But after he was cut during training camp, O’Neill headed back to his hometown of Youngstown, Ohio, and got involved in the theater program at the local university.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Katey Sagal as Peggy Bundy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/1-5.png><p>In 1985, newcomer actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katey Sagal</a> beat out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathy Bates</a> for the role of Jo Tucker, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mary Tyler Moore</a>’s sharp-tongued coworker on the TV series Mary. But the show was cancelled after its first season, and Sagal went on to audition Married… with Children.</p><p>The character of Peggy was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">originally written as a drab couch potato</a>, but Sagal showed up to the audition with a bouffant and six-inch heels.

She played a young <a href=#>Grace Kelly</a> in a TV biopic and landed guest roles on classic sitcoms like Charles in Charge and <a href=#>Silver Spoons</a>. But it was her role as the beautiful but airheaded Kelly Bundy that launched her into superstardom.</p><p>While Married… with Children was still on the air, Applegate starred in the 1991 cult classic Don’t Tell Mom the Babysitters Dead and hosted Saturday Night Live. Since the show ended, she’s had starring roles in Jesse, Samantha Who?, and Dead to Me, along with an Emmy-winning guest spot on Friends as Rachel’s insufferable sister. She also landed major movie roles in the Anchorman series, Vacation, and Bad Moms.</p><p>After being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, Applegate underwent a double mastectomy and made a full recovery. But in 2021, Applegate revealed that she has multiple sclerosis. After struggling to finish filming the final season of Dead to Me due to her diagnosis, Applegate told Vanity Fair she’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unlikely to work on-camera again</a>, but hopes to continue with voice work.

As a child actor, he had bit roles in TV shows like Family Ties and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Love Boat</a> before landing his breakout role as Bud, the awkward and scheming younger brother.</p><p>Since Married… with Children ended, Faustino has mostly focused on voice work, including roles in Not Another B Movie, DreamWorks Dragons, and this year’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.</p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p><p>Faustino and Applegate weren’t the first choice to play Bud and Kelly. But after filming the original pilot with different actors, producers felt the chemistry was off, and the roles were recast with Faustino and Applegate. It was a lucky twist of fate for both of them — and for the viewers, because we can’t imagine anyone else as the Bundy siblings.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>80s Child Actors: 11 of Our Favorite TV Stars Then and Now</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Amanda Bearse as Marcy D’Arcy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/4-5.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amanda Bearse</a> studied directing at the American Film Institute and the University of Southern California before making her debut on the soap opera All My Children.
