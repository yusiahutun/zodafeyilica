London's biggest breakfast show, alongside Dave Berry and former model Lilah.</p><p>And it turns out since their studio's have had a fancy new re-design, things can unfortunately not appear to be all that they seem.</p><p>As the gang sit across from each other in their swanky new studios, George explained that everything is now filmed for their website.</p><p>The star sat down with Daily Star Online and exclusively revealed that the cameras often catch the radio presenters doing silly things.</p><p>He joked: "Lilah sometimes wears crop tops and the computers sometimes cut it off, making it look like she's naked."</p><a class=gallery-interaction href=# data-link-tracking=inArticle|slideshow><span>X Factor's biggest earners</span> <img

broadcast to the world online, saying: "There's times you go to pick your nose and then you remember 'oh no, I'm being filmed' so you have to go outside to pick your nose.</p><p>"You just forget you're being filmed."</p><p>The star also explained that he doesn't always feel pressure doing the show, because he forgets about the outside world.</p><p>He went on: "You kind of forget because we're in here, everything is filmed, everything goes on social media.</p><p>"You forget that you're on air, for when we're in here we've got each other's banter and it's nice that the rest of London are finding it funny too."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19135696.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_UNION-J-546197><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;George publicly addressed his sexuality in an emotional clip back in February.</p><p>The 22-year-old was quick to point out he didn't want to label anything, and said: "It's all these labels and it's a little bit old-fashioned and this is why I'm not going to label it myself.</p><p>"I've had girlfriends that I've loved.</p><p>"But I've also had boyfriends."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19135695.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GEORGE-SHELLEY-546177><p>He explained: "It wasn't a big thing and it shouldn't be for anyone.</p><p>"The reason of not putting a label on it was really interesting too.</p><p>"The fact that I didn't say 'I'm gay, or bi, or straight' in the video, it was really interesting to watch all the other outlets say 'George comes out as bi'.</p><p>"It was like 'yeah ok, if you wanna put a label on it, I guess thats what you did' but it's interesting to see how people still don't get it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The former Union J singer continued: "It's a simple thing to say 'don't label it', just get over it and be you, but people still have to do it.</p><p>"And people's response, people who were close to me were like 'he's not come out as bi, he's not come out as gay' and all these headlines were coming out.</p><p>"It was just interesting to see that people were still labelling it."</p><p>Don't expect to see the star stripping off for your standard shirtless Gay Times shoot any time soon either.</p><p>Not because he hasn't had the chance, but instead George doesn't want to do that "because its so obvious".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>He explained: "Those things did come to me, and I was like 'I've said what I want to say' and It's just a bit obvious.</p><p>"I mean people get those kind of shoots if they're straight, just because they've got a good body."</p><p>"I didn't come out as gay, so it wouldn't make sense for me to be like 'I'm gay, here is me naked' on Gay Times.</p><p>"If I was just to say I'm straight I wouldn't be photographed on the front of like woman's weekly just because I say i'm straight.</p><p>"Why should it just be because I'm gay I've got to be on gay mags, I don't know."</p><a href=#>Instagram</a><p>Just like the rest of us, the cheeky chappy also worries about his appearance, and said one reason he hasn't done that sort of shoot yet is because: "My body is not good enough to put on a shoot."</p><p>However, George is more than happy to work on creative and artistic pieces, and explained he enjoys working with friend Damon Baker.</p><p>He said: "The photos I've done with done with Damon Baker of me topless, that would be perfect for something like Gay Times or Attitude, but I'm not doing it because I'm gay.</p><p>"I'm doing it because I want to create a photo, not because I want to show off, or stick a label on it."</p><p>The X Factor star also told us his new job helps him start his day right.</p><p>He explained: "What I really like about it is that it's a lovely way to start your day, and it's really healthy to get up early.</p><p>"I spend 4 hours in the studio with Dave and Lilah, and you're set up for the rest of the day.</p><p>Meanwhile, it looks like George could be heading back to where his showbiz career was born, The X Factor.</p><p>The star is reportedly in talks for a job on spinoff show The Xtra Factor, as a "social media correspondent".</p><p>While an X Factor spokesperson has explained no final decisions have been made, it wouldn't be an unlikely move for the star.</p><p>Tune into the Capital London Breakfast show with Dave Berry, George and Lilah weekdays 6-10am.</p><p class=postsid
