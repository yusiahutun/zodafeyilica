However, StyleCaster may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>A few warm days in the middle of February, and we’re thinking about <a href=#>spring and summer 2024 trends</a> already. The shows for this season happened last September, and now that we’ve had time to metabolize them, as well as the television, film, <a href=#>beauty trends</a>, and culture that influence clothes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new fashion trends for 2024</a> are coming into view.</p><p>It’s always potentially scary when old things come back in style. We were only just recently swearing to never repeat our past sins of business casual at the club and capris, only for them to look oh-so tempting again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1698872553.jpg><p>But that’s how we live in harmony. We fall in love with things, then betray them, then want them back. We never learn, and that’s beautiful. But there’s something interesting looming in the air. Fashion writer Alexandra Hildreth reported on this last fall, but <a href=# rel=nofollow>everybody is a fashion critic</a> now. Maybe because the video essay is a format at our fingertips, maybe because there is so much fashion everywhere. Influencers have to stand out from each other, and the only way to do that is to have an opinion, according to the myriad of people she spoke to for the story.</p><p>One such common opinion these days is the anti-trend. Trends have always been optional to participate in, and they kind of have to be if you want a wardrobe you actually like. But trend seems to have become a bad word, something cheap, something inauthentic, something untrustworthy. And in a sea of cores and aesthetics often arising, not from an actual trend, but from TikTok users’ desire to coin a new trend or phrase, I can see where the distrust comes from.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>In a TikTok interview, Fashion Magazine asked model Alex Consani for one trend she hates, and she said, “I don’t really hate any trend, no shade, but I hate when people feel like a trend has to be done. Like, live your truth. If you wanna wear what you wanna wear, do what you wanna do, do it because you wanna do it.” And that exact attitude toward fashion is in the drinking water. It’s pervasive. The big bad voices of fashion are pushing back on the feeling that trends are imposed onto us, and inviting the notion that trends up to us.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3021235521236><h2>Pit Crew</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jackets-trend.png><p>Ten years ago, it was the motorcycle jacket, and now it’s the racer jacket.

The new wave of emo kids are getting handpoke tattoo supplies from Amazon (legally we can’t recommend this) and posing in their mirror selfies with Sanpaku eyes.

The look of this coat is naturally more formal than a classic canvas trench which actually gives it more styling versatility.

Mega bags are here to crush all of the other 2024 handbag trends—those Jacquemus mini bags better watch out! Designers like Brandon Maxwell, Sandy Liang, and STAUD proved that the bigger the bag, the better.

From home decor accents and wedding color schemes to brand campaigns, this color made every palette more palpable. However, over the last few years, the shade disappeared from collections as quickly as the phrase “girl boss” disappeared from our vernacular. The bright shade of Barbie Pink took its place and has hopefully (finally) run its course. According to designers like Carolina Herrera, Simone Rocha, and Tory Burch, it’s time to add Millennial Pink back into our closets. Based on the Spring/Summer ’24 collections, you can expect to see the shade heavily incorporated into formal wear—no 2024 bridesmaid is safe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-New-Day-Womens-Maxine-Slingback-Ballet-Flats.webp?w=650"><p>Switching up your footwear is one of the easiest ways to incorporate trends into your wardrobe. Although these <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>sling-back flats</a> technically include multiple shades of pink, the millennial shade is part of the mix, and while they look similar to styles from Chanel, they ring in at just $30.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lululemon-Scuba-Oversized-Funnel-Neck-Half-Zip.jpeg><p>There’s no limit to when or where you can rock this shade, so naturally, it deserves to be worked into your fitness and loungewear outfits, too. By swapping out your beige half-zip for this <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>light pink Lululemon one</a>, you’ll instantly give your relaxed look some fashion-forward flair…even if the only place you’re heading is back to the couch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Aupen-Bag.jpg><p>Carrying a colorful purse is the perfect way to add a pop of color — and some excitement — to an otherwise simple outfit. Not only does this <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Aupen shoulder bag</a> nail the millennial pink trend, it also has an eye-catching, asymmetrical shape that’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift-approved</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.1171341925701><h2>Bunches of Lilac</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-19-at-1.17.48-PM.png><p>If you aren’t excited about the return of Millennial Pink, maybe this shade of lilac will make up for it. Lilac is a color that, dare I say, genuinely looks good on everyone and works in many forms. The soft hue looks inviting when woven into a chunky winter sweater and looks as whimsical as a lace summer dress. The shade is seasonless which means there’s no excuse to wait to wear it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Abercrombie-Draped-Ruffle-Midi-Dress.jpeg><p>One way to work this shade into your wardrobe is with a ruffled dress, similar to this design we saw on 3.1 Phillip Lim’s runway.

Metallic gold is sure to win you over in 2024. Gold automatically makes any outfit appear more formal. For special occasions, use Blumarine’s stunning gold strapless dress as inspiration. If you’re looking to score extra points in the office, consider adding metallic accents as demonstrated on the Miu Miu runway. Rabanne made a strong case for mixed metals with a gold and silver set. The trend can have a gladiator look—if you want to tone it down, pair metallic gold with alternate materials like denim or leather.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mango-Metallic-knit-top.jpg><p>You don’t need a full metallic dress to nail this particular trend. A <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>simple gold tank</a> will do and will probably prove to be even more versatile.

Preppy fashion is back and Miu Miu is leading the charge with polos, layered collared shirts, boat shoes, and elastic waist mini skirts. In Miu Miu’s collection, the trend is taking on the full Y2K identity but you can still find more classic versions of preppy style in 2024. Brands like Bally and Tods took a more streamlined approach to preppy fashion with pleated skirts, thin belts, and collared, short-sleeved button-up shirts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/SNDYS-Colbie-Varsity-Sweater-1.jpg><p>Is it a dress?
