Just to equalize things we’re going to throw the rest of his family in there we want you to like this article. In a way, it is always about the actor just through the lives of people close to him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Channing Tatum’s Wife</strong></h2><p>Born Jenna Lee Dewan on December 3 1980 the actress has much in common with her popular husband. First of all, Jenna is an actress but she wasn’t always an actress. She started as a relief dancer for Janet Jackson and even accompanied the artist on her ‘All For You’ tour. She gives a lot of credit to the musician for helping her boost her career by developing the necessary skills that earned her the role of Nora in ‘<b><a href=# rel=noopener>Step Up’ (2006)</a>.</b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Channing-Tatum-1-640x480.jpg><p>She should probably thank her even more because that’s where Jenna met her husband Channing Tatum. Their real relationship started after they finished shooting the film and it only got better. Two years later they got engaged then BOOM they got married on July 11, 2009.</p><p>Since then they have been parading around giving everyone mixed feelings because we are on the fence when it comes to envying them. They’re so cute together! On May 31 2013 after wearing a pretty baby bump for a while Jenna and her husband welcomed their daughter Everly Elizabeth Maiselle Tatum into the world.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Tom Hardy’s Wife, Teeth, Kids, Height, Age, Net Worth, Tattoos</a></strong></p><p>Like her husband, Jenna is passionate about film and has appeared in more than a couple of films and television series. She played a recurring role in the FX series ‘American Horror Story; Asylum’. She also played Freya Beauchamp in the series ‘Witches Of East End’ and more recently in 2016 she played the recurring role of Lucy Lane in ‘Supergirl’. So here’s the scoop on Channing Tatum’s wife.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Channing Tatum’s Daughter</strong></h2><p>She was born Everly Elizabeth Maiselle Tatum on May 31 2013 because two names are not enough and three are simply boring. Everly was born in London England and was obviously a source of joy in her parents’ lives. If you thought the pictures of Channing and his wife were cute you’ll spit them out when you see the cute pictures the couple takes of and with their daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Channing-Tatums-Wife.jpg><p>Since dancing has facilitated their careers and brought them closer together, there is no doubt that the couple wants to pass this on to their daughter, as recently as last month, they gave her a dance class with her dancing buddies, Snapchat has all the evidence.</p><p>Her mother, Jenna, who is an animal rights activist and vegan, raises Everly as a vegetarian. Before you started making a fuss, she also added that she would allow her to choose her favorite eating habits when she is old enough. In the meantime, no meat for this little girl.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Tom Cruise Son, Daughter, Kids</a></strong></p><p>Does Channing also follow a “meat-free diet”, you may ask? We’ll let Tatum’s wife answer that question for all of you. In the July/August issue of Women’s Health Magazine, she revealed: “Jenna revealed: “He really tried to be vegan for six months. This guy doesn’t like vegetables, which makes things difficult. It was difficult at first because you want someone to be on the same page, but you have to let people be themselves.</p><p>She wouldn’t mind if Everly chose to go vegan.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Channing Tatum’s Parent’s</strong></h2><p>Their names are Glenn and Kay Tatum, and they are responsible for the release of Channing Tatum and all his kindness to the world. Glenn was a construction worker, while his wife Kay was an air transport worker. It was a middle-class family, and although his parents were not rich, they bought their children everything they needed.</p><p>That’s why they were surprised to learn that his film,‘Magic Mike‘, was based on him. Obviously, there is no easy way to make your parents understand that you were an exotic dancer at one time or another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Channing-Tatums-Daughter.jpg><p>About that Tatum told E! News that his father had asked him: “Why? Why? You didn’t need the money. We have always provided. These are not the words you want to hear from your father associated with a look of helpless disappointment Tatum replied “I told him it had nothing to do with him. That was my route. This was the road I had to take.</p><p>When asked about his mother Tatum said “My mother is literally one of the kindest and most understanding people on earth. So we know we have a mama’s boy. In addition to her parents, Channing has two brothers and sisters a brother-in-law Christopher Anderson who is also an actor, and her sister Paige Tatum.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Zac Efron’s Boyfriend, Brother, And Parents</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts About Channing Tatum</strong></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody readability=5><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"></i>&nbsp;Date of Birth:</th><td><span class="value birthday">26 April 1980</span></td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-adjust"></i>&nbsp;Age:</th><td>41 years old</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></i>&nbsp;Birth Nation:</th><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-tower"></i>&nbsp;Height:</th><td>6 Feet 2 Inch</td></tr><tr><th>Name</th><td>Channing Tatum</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Name</th><td>Channing Matthew Tatum</td></tr><tr><th>Father</th><td>Glenn Tatum</td></tr><tr><th>Mother</th><td>Kay Tatum</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place/City</th><td>Cullman, Alabama</td></tr><tr readability=5><th>Profession</th><td>Actor, film producer, dancer, and former model</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$ 50 million</td></tr><tr><th>Weight in KG</th><td>82.1kg</td></tr><tr><th>Married</th><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><th>Married to</th><td>Jenna Dewan</td></tr><tr><th>Children</th><td>Everly Elizabeth Tatum</td></tr><tr readability=5><th>Online Presence</th><td>Facebook, Twitter, Wiki, Instagram</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksKmtzaegp59dqa61wcysZLChlpp6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJirq%2BwjKmYq52eqcBw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchanning-tatums-wife-daughter-and-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchanning-tatums-wife-daughter-and-parents.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchanning-tatums-wife-daughter-and-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchanning-tatums-wife-daughter-and-parents.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchanning-tatums-wife-daughter-and-parents.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchanning-tatums-wife-daughter-and-parents.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dwts-host-alfoso-ribeiro-relationship-with-will-smith-in-his-own-words.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dwts-host-alfoso-ribeiro-relationship-with-will-smith-in-his-own-words.html>DWTS host Alfonso Ribeiro's relationship with Will Smith in his own words</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cat-eye-eyeliner-to-smokey-eye-6-times-deepika-padukones-eye-makeup-made-us-want-to-recreate-her-look-1284756.html>Cat eye eyeliner to smokey eye; 6 times Deepika Padukones eye makeup made us want to recreate her</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cat-eye-eyeliner-to-smokey-eye-6-times-deepika-padukones-eye-makeup-made-us-want-to-recreate-her-look-1284756.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
