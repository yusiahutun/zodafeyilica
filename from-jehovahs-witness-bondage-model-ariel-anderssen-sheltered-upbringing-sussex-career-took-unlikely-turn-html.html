Yesterday she played a teacher mysteriously turned on while reading Aldous Huxley to her class.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 46-year-old then spent 30 minutes on her <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-ed4274e0-379e-11ee-9bef-c3e06c24c707>OnlyFans</a> account, answering questions and adding behind-the-scenes content.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Anderssen is a BDSM model: bondage, discipline (or dominance), submission (or sadism) and masochism.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her husband, Hywel Phillips, 54 (a particle physicist turned fetish photographer), is a dominant sadist. Anderssen calls herself a submissive masochist. They live in Wales because they both love hill walking.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It’s not the life she expected growing up as a Jehovah’s Witness in 1970s and 1980s Sussex. (Her mother had been converted by a member of the religion who knocked on their door while she was living in Oxfordshire.)&nbsp;</p><img id=i-3a1880ed745b2d1a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/10/01/74149009-12391425-image-a-53_1691627339754.jpg height=845 width=633 alt="Anderssen is a BDSM model: bondage, discipline (or dominance), submission (or sadism) and masochism" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Anderssen is a BDSM model: bondage, discipline (or dominance), submission (or sadism) and masochism</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Like lots of people then, she was terrified of nuclear war, and my dad was a nuclear physicist, so she was in possession of some really horrible facts,’ says Anderssen.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The Jehovah’s Witnesses had a solution: “Yes, the end of the world is coming, but we’ll show you how to survive.” How could my dad, a scientist, have gone along with it? I guess he could see it made my mum less frightened.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The religion isolated Anderssen. ‘That’s the point: we were meant to see ourselves as different. You can’t celebrate Christmas. We weren’t allowed to listen to pop music.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Our family didn’t have a TV. So we had little in common with our peers.’ Jehovah’s Witnesses must dress modestly and Anderssen’s mum made pinafores for her and her sister.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I don’t think it occurred to her how weird it made us look to be dressed like Victorians in the 80s!’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It wasn’t a miserable childhood. They were a loving unit in a tightknit community. Her parents were quirkily liberal in many ways, especially around body positivity.&nbsp;</p>MY HUSBAND HAS BOLT CUTTERS AND SOME SPARE HANDCUFF KEYS&nbsp;<p class=mol-para-with-font>‘My parents had been affected by hippie culture. They were casually naked, like naturists, and it didn’t occur to me that it was weird.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Anderssen saw no point in school work – much of her childhood was spent reading books, immersed in her imagination.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Even then she was drawn to tales of kidnap, imprisonment and punishment. There was&nbsp;no sexual element, just fascination, she says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I can’t see anything in my background that would have created it. My sister had the same upbringing and she’s not kinky. I think it was like buried treasure, waiting to be discovered.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The discovery came when she was 25.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The family had left the Jehovah’s Witnesses – her dad could no longer square it with his science and her mum had knocked on the door of a Baptist minister to convert him, only to be invited in for a chat and eventually converted by him. (She is now a Methodist.)&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Anderssen’s sister, Imogen, left home to marry young – her husband is a vicar.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Through her late teens and early 20s, Anderssen struggled with a growing awareness that BDSM turned her on.</p><img id=i-383879d9a36abda1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/10/17/74149013-12391425-Jehovah_s_Witnesses_must_dress_modestly_and_Anderssen_s_mum_made-a-74_1691686610746.jpg height=838 width=634 alt="Jehovah’s Witnesses must dress modestly and Anderssen’s mum made pinafores for her and her sister.

Ariel, right, aged four, with sister Imogen, eight</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It seemed as bad as being a paedophile,’ she says. ‘All I could do was suppress it.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was living in London, working as an actress and model, when she stumbled across a BDSM photography exhibition under Waterloo station. It felt like an ‘electric shock’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The images were very classy,’ she says. ‘Sepia prints of ladies in Victorian underwear and handcuffs, or lying on a bed with a cane next to them. Very non-graphic – but it was an affirmation; a community I could join.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Anderssen arranged to model for the man behind the images: erotic-art photographer China Hamilton. She remembers him picking her up from a train station in Suffolk, driving to his beautiful house (stuffed with antiques – he was also a clocksmith) and asking her about her fantasies.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He told her she was a ‘true submissive masochist’. He was a ‘sexual sadist’ who was married but had a ‘slave’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It blew my mind,’ she says. ‘I’d been a virgin until I was 23 and had one sexual partner. I was stepping into a world where anything seemed possible…’ A world of magazines, websites, collectors and collaborators who would pay to tie her up, suspend her from the ceiling and spank her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now Anderssen has written a book about her transformation. At times it’s hard to read; take the four days she spent making films for collectors.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Halfway through, she wondered how much more her body could take. Would multiple clamps and hooks, along with foot torture, combine to make her pass out?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Consent is paramount. ‘If a photographer does something unexpected, it can be terrifying. In 2019, I arrived for what I thought was a stills photo shoot.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The man tied me up, started a camera, pulled out a knife and threatened me with it. It turned out to be rubber but I’d never work with him again.&nbsp;He didn’t understand the rules.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It’s not a job without risks. Anderssen had an irregular heartbeat for 18 months after getting a shock from an ‘electro play device’.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Once she was tied on the floor when a forest of burning candles above her dislodged; one landed on her ankle. She still has the scar.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Safety, she says, is sexy. That’s partly what attracted her to her husband, whom she met while modelling for his bondage site. ‘He always has a fire extinguisher, bolt cutters, a spare set of handcuff keys. If you feel the person in charge is responsible and in control, that’s hot.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She fears the rise of violent porn and its impact on young people. ‘There’s a load of really respectful, loving, beautiful stuff but it’s behind paywalls because it’s made by people who do not want children seeing it,’ she says.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I hate the idea that teenage boys watch the nastiest, most violent porn they can find then emulate it.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her 11-year marriage sounds like a comfortable (and uncomfortable) mix of hardcore kink and low-key domesticity.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By a strange quirk, their house was once a whisky maltings, and it has a dungeon-like space just off the kitchen, now a handy bondage studio. They’ve never kept anything hidden in their small Welsh town.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Someone came to fix our washing machine, which is in our kit room with our bondage stuff,’ she says. ‘He asked what it was, so we explained. He said, “Oh yeah, I’m a cross-dresser!” When you’re honest, people are honest back. A lot of us are into something a bit unusual.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Even Anderssen’s parents know what she does – they’re unfazed by the nudity, but she has withheld more explicit details. Although she and Phillips chose not to be parents, Anderssen is close to her sister’s children – one made a documentary about her for her university film course. Anderssen’s sister is her PA: ‘It’s funny that a lot of my emails are being written from a vicarage!’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Somehow, Anderssen has built a life that incorporates everything and everyone she loves. She has no plans to slow down.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’ve&nbsp;got model friends in their 60s and 70s who are still very successful,’ she says. ‘I want to see how far I can go.’</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=mol-style-bold>Playing to Lose: How a Jehovah’s Witness Became a Submissive BDSM Model by Ariel Anderssen (Unbound, £14.99)*</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCforJwxc6uZpqqpJ6wrbGMamlscWFpf3Z7paumpmV6mrWwwsChqmaPmam7pr%2FSZpmoppSWtKZ5zKibnqRddr%2BqsctmeKeclafAtLHNZqqhnZypsrOxw2asqZqinruotc2gZIyto6iyuXnCmqmenaJiwbC7ymasp6SZoLKtxYytrKumXp3Brrg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrom-jehovahs-witness-bondage-model-ariel-anderssen-sheltered-upbringing-sussex-career-took-unlikely-turn-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffrom-jehovahs-witness-bondage-model-ariel-anderssen-sheltered-upbringing-sussex-career-took-unlikely-turn-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffrom-jehovahs-witness-bondage-model-ariel-anderssen-sheltered-upbringing-sussex-career-took-unlikely-turn-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffrom-jehovahs-witness-bondage-model-ariel-anderssen-sheltered-upbringing-sussex-career-took-unlikely-turn-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrom-jehovahs-witness-bondage-model-ariel-anderssen-sheltered-upbringing-sussex-career-took-unlikely-turn-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrom-jehovahs-witness-bondage-model-ariel-anderssen-sheltered-upbringing-sussex-career-took-unlikely-turn-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jeff-gordon-and-amanda-church.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jeff-gordon-and-amanda-church.html>Jeff Gordon and Amanda Church</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./choosing-forgiveness-michelle-zauner-essay.html>Michelle Zauner on Choosing to Forgive Her Estranged Father for Starting a New Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./choosing-forgiveness-michelle-zauner-essay.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
