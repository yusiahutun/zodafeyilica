Instead, it showed her former pal her true nature, a royal author has said.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> is comfortable speaking out about issues that are close to her heart. That’s pretty clear. The Duchess of Sussex has opened up over difficult conversations, life as a <a href=#>royal</a>, and her upbringing with a black mother and white father. She’s also a feminist, who has countlessly made speeches empowering other women. For her 40th birthday, Archewell – the organization she set up with <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> after leaving The Firm – launched 40X40. It promoted mentoring women who were trying to get back into the workforce after the pandemic. But it’s easy to see what attributes she holds dear by traveling back in time. One royal author has put the spotlight on the encounter between Meghan Markle and the school bully when her friend stood up for herself.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-s-encounter-with-the-school-bully>Meghan Markle’s encounter with the school bully</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-11-at-13.04.00-1024x577.png><p>Andrew Morton, author of Meghan: A <a href=#>Hollywood</a> Princess, detailed the incident at school. He <a href=# rel=nofollow>spoke to a former classmate</a> of the Duchess, Elizabeth McCoy.</p><p>Elizabeth McCoy recalled: ‘You never forget the people who were mean to you and who was nice.</p><p>“That’s why I have never forgotten Meghan.</p><p>“She was one of the most righteous people I have ever met. If someone was being treated unfairly she stuck up for one.</p><p>“On one occasion I made the girl who bullied me cry.</p><p>“I tried to apologize and Meghan sided with the other girl because she was in tears'”.</p><p>Elizabeth explained that Meghan sided with her school bully, as she had been hurt at that time after McCoy stood up for herself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-s-attitude-has-always-been-to-protect-people>Meghan’s attitude has always been to ‘protect’ people</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-11-at-13.02.15-1024x567.png><p>McCoy added: “‘Meghan called it like it was. She was going to defend those who needed it. Her attitude was: “I can see you are hurt, and I’m going to protect you.”</p><p>“She was genuinely decent human being who looked out for peopled who needed help. She gave a damn about people other than herself.'”</p><p>Although, it wasn’t all plain-sailing. <a href=#>TV</a> star, Nema Vand, from Shahs of Sunset, went to the same high school as Meghan in LA. He spoke about knowing the former royal in a podcast in 2020.</p><p>He did say that “everyone was in love with her” and called Meghan “sweet” and very “kind”.</p><p>But he claimed she was a ‘game player’ and ‘toyed with hearts’.</p><p>Vand gave his own anecdote of an intimate moment with the Suits actor.</p><p>“She knew what she was doing,” he said. “She toyed with our hearts masterfully. We were at a party one time, and she sat on my lap. She got nose to nose with me. For a 16-year-old guy, that is an emotional moment. She said to me in Farsi, ‘You are so beautiful.’ I asked her, ‘How do you know Farsi?’ She said, ‘I learned it for you.’ Then she walked away.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-duchess-of-sussex-faced-struggles-at-school>The Duchess of Sussex faced struggles at school</h2><p>Morton also writes about how the 42-year-old learned her sense of right and wrong from her mother <a href=#>Doria Ragland</a>.</p><p>During one upsetting incident, Morton says the ‘mean girls’ of the school said they were announcing a ‘White Girls Only’ club and wanted Meghan to join.</p><p>Meghan supposedly responded with ‘Are you kidding me?’ and it shut them up pretty fast.</p><p>But that playground confrontation came at a time when Meghan was struggling to understand herself due to her dual heritage.</p><p>Not long after, in Christmas 1988, <a href=#>her dad Thomas Markle</a>, who was her biggest support growing up, took a step.</p><p>He purchased two sets of Heart dolls, one with black dolls and another with white. He then mixed them together to represent Meghan’s own family, and wrapped them up and placed the box under the tree.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2Z%2BcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55krKGUnruoedaiq6Flo5i1sLvLZpmupJyuerG%2Bzq%2BcnWWYmr9uwNGunGamkanCs7GMnJ%2BipJSdvLCwjJ%2Bpop2emXq0rdisZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeghan-markle-siding-with-school-bully-proved-her-true-nature-childhood-friend-says.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeghan-markle-siding-with-school-bully-proved-her-true-nature-childhood-friend-says.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeghan-markle-siding-with-school-bully-proved-her-true-nature-childhood-friend-says.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeghan-markle-siding-with-school-bully-proved-her-true-nature-childhood-friend-says.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeghan-markle-siding-with-school-bully-proved-her-true-nature-childhood-friend-says.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeghan-markle-siding-with-school-bully-proved-her-true-nature-childhood-friend-says.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./545003-side-girl-shares-hilarious-regret-hides-closet-mans-house.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./545003-side-girl-shares-hilarious-regret-hides-closet-mans-house.html>Side Chick Shares Hilarious Regret As She Hides In Closet At Man's House: &amp;quot;Never Going Back&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./davenport-police-identify-victim-in-deadly-shooting.html>Davenport Police identify victim in deadly shooting</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./davenport-police-identify-victim-in-deadly-shooting.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
