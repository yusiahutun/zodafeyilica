She has competed on 25 of the show's 31 seasons, as well as one season on "DWTS: Juniors."</p><p>"There’s so much more that I want to do, other than teach a celebrity how to dance," Burke told Variety.

She said that in some ways this decision is a part of her continuing growth amid these life changes.</p><p>"I’ve done a lot of work and soul searching," said Burke. "It sounds so cliché, and I know I’ve been blessed to be given a platform like 'Dancing With the Stars.' I would like to really show other sides of me, especially when it comes to mental health."</p><p>As part of that ambition, Burke shared that she's been working on a dance program for the past decade called Body Language, with the intent of launching in 2023.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:eb4aa3f6-8fcc-4e50-9bed-7ac7d1948482 data-container-ref=toofab:article:709bad0c-88a8-45cc-8ebe-dcfaadd8289c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/86/5by4/2022/11/15/86d286deb0ed46d9abe68ba4d78f6b46_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bachelorette Gabby Windey's Ex-Fiance Breaks Silence After She Revealed Breakup on DWTS</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It’s just another resource people can add to their list of resources when they’re feeling down or depressed," she explained. "Movement has played a huge role in my life. I’ve always said movement has saved my life. Dance has saved my life, and I want to make that attainable for everybody."</p><p>In regards to the decision to step away, Burke suggested that it's been on her mind since the beginning of the season, and said that it "has been a long time coming." But she doesn't see it as a step away but a "move forward."</p><p>"There’s also another opportunity for me to be a part of a show that is very popular, but I can’t say more because nothing has been signed yet," Burke teased.</p><p>In a previous video where she hinted she might be considering stepping away, she also teased that she might still be a part of the show. That video came out before Goodman's retirement announcement.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3005c29f-91d6-429d-b9e0-85805901f449 data-container-ref=toofab:article:709bad0c-88a8-45cc-8ebe-dcfaadd8289c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7d/5by4/2021/11/04/7dbad09cdfc14851817066a70e585eec_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">These Celebrities Were Forced To Quit Dancing With The Stars</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>So is that the big news she can't spill yet? There is certainly precedent. <a href=#>Derek Hough</a>, himself a decorated "DWTS" alum, permanently joined the panel permanently after standing in for Goodman in 2020 (and after serving as a judge on <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez'</a> "World of Dance" from 2017 to 2020.</p><p>According to Burke, producers are "very well aware" that she wants the judging position, and have been for a few years. "It’s not that I just want it, I just know that I can contribute because I am an expert in ballroom dancing," she noted. "I can say that with confidence."</p><p>Burke went on to point out why she'd be a good replacement for the no-nonsense Goodman, too, adding that her methods "haven’t been known to being sugar coated." She said, "Len is really technical and really tells you how it is. That is my style."</p><p>She also said that "it would be nice to see two women on the panel!" If it doesn't happen with the show, though, Burke said she's still "moving forward" and "moving on."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fbba7c99-cf43-4c52-91fe-75b8e7bde50e data-container-ref=toofab:article:709bad0c-88a8-45cc-8ebe-dcfaadd8289c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5b/5by4/2022/11/15/5b536d408d7d44ffa276876bfbe689c0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Disney+</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">DWTS 5th Judge Semifinals: Double Elimination, Pregnancy Announcement, One Judge Leaving</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Burke will perform her last dance on the show with fellow professionals <a href=#>Louis Van Amstel</a> and <a href=#>Pasha Pashkov</a> as a professional dancer. Of course, Hough becoming a judge hasn't stopped him from performing in the ballroom, so we'd imagine that opportunity would be available for Burke as well, should she be so inclined.</p><p>It should be a touching tribute for Burke and for Van Amstel, who returned to the show this season after seven years (and ten seasons) away. Burke said she gives him full credit for convincing producers to interview her in the first place.</p><p>"We did this dance [in Season 2] to <a href=#>Barry Manilow’s</a> 'Copacabana.' We’re doing kind of a remixed version of it," Burke told Variety. "I’m starting it off with Pasha, and we’re doing an Argentine Tango to celebrate a big farewell party as my last dance in the ballroom, which is so sad."</p><p>You can read Cheryl's full farewell announcement she posted to her Instagram Stories below.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3f/o/2022/11/20/3f3305e23f5449e6baa32718412a5202_md.jpg width=825 height=1303 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p>Burke's big farewell -- for now? -- goes down on the "Dancing with the Stars" season finale, Monday night at 8 p.m. ET on Disney+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGpma2hfmLWmvtilZJutoqCybrjEmq2ippdisaK6wqKloGWnnsGpedOhnGarpJa%2FtHnDsKusZaCnvG6wwKeanqpdrK6vwNJmq6hlmqqxqLGO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcheryl-burke-leaving-dancing-with-the-stars-dwts-pro-dancer-wants-to-judge.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcheryl-burke-leaving-dancing-with-the-stars-dwts-pro-dancer-wants-to-judge.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcheryl-burke-leaving-dancing-with-the-stars-dwts-pro-dancer-wants-to-judge.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcheryl-burke-leaving-dancing-with-the-stars-dwts-pro-dancer-wants-to-judge.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcheryl-burke-leaving-dancing-with-the-stars-dwts-pro-dancer-wants-to-judge.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcheryl-burke-leaving-dancing-with-the-stars-dwts-pro-dancer-wants-to-judge.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jack-nunge.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jack-nunge.html>Jack Nunge Bio, Age, Parents, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./organizational-effectiveness.html>6 Best Steps for organizational effectiveness</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./organizational-effectiveness.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
