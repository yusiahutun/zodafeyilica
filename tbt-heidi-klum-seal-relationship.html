Getting engaged, tying the knot in Mexico, renewing their vows, and raising their four children (Seal adopted Klum's&nbsp;eldest daughter, Leni, when she was 5 years old) were just a few events&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the timeless beauty</a>&nbsp;and the "Kiss from a Rose" singer experienced together before filing for divorce in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After finalizing their divorce in 2014, Klum began dating German musician Tom Kaulitz in 2018;&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the couple wed</a>&nbsp;in 2019.

The supermodel was sitting with a mutual friend when Seal walked through the door wearing tight-fitting bike shorts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He came in just from the gym, and I was sitting there, and I was, like, 'wow,'" she told Oprah Winfrey,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>according to&nbsp;People</a>, during the TV host's "Superstar Couples" episode in 2007. "And I pretty much saw everything.

"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">People have said I was such a good person, so courageous," Seal added. "I honestly don't see it like that. I was the lucky one. We didn't have time for the usual pre-marital dance that couples get into. For the first time in my life, I had total clarity in a relationship, and I knew exactly what I had to do."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-december-23-2004-heidi-klum-and-seal-get-engaged></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>December 23, 2004: Heidi Klum and Seal get engaged</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>James Devaney / WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout their relationship, the couple showed their affection with grand gestures.

Online</a>, which he had specially built for the occasion, on top of a "secluded natural glacier" in Canada two days before Christmas. From there, it was a competition of one-upmanship.

Over the course of their marriage, Klum told&nbsp;The Sunday Times, as&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>reported by&nbsp;People</a>, that they orchestrated eight weddings (each with their own theme on their anniversary).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's so special to us, something we love and something our children have gotten accustomed to," Heidi previously&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told&nbsp;People</a>&nbsp;of the tradition.

Best of all? Not only were their voices in sync, but also their outfits.

"We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The statement continued: "This is an amicable process, and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.
