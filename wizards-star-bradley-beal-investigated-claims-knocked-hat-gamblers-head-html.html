One member of the group allegedly yelled 'you made me lose $1,300, you f***,' at Beal.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Beal confronted the fan, calling him 'disrespectful' while appearing to knock a hat of one man's head as the two sides continued to jaw at each other, according to the police report.</p><br><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Keep it a buck,' Beal said, according to TMZ. 'I don't give a f*** about none of your bets or your parlays, bro. That ain't why I play the game.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Beal was then ushered into the locker room without further incident.

While greeting the players, [redacted]'s friend made a remark to Washington Wizards player Bradley Beal, stating something along the lines of, 'you made me lose $1300 you f****'. Immediately after the comment was made [redacted] stated Beal approached him and with his right hand, swatted his hat off his head. In doing so Beal made contact with the left side of his head, hitting him. [Redacted] did not give Beal permission to touch or strike him. [Redacted] provided me a copy of the footage showing the incident, which was entered into Evidence.com.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'While watching the video footage of the altercation, I observed the basketball players exiting the Amway arena through the tunnel, where fans were standing by to meet the players. Beal is seen walking through the tunnel and [redacted] makes a remark stating to Beal, 'you made me lose $1300 you f***'. Beal, about 20 feet away from where [redacted] and [redacted] were standing, turned around and walked back towards them.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Beal was then seen making a swatting motion with his right hand towards where [redacted] was standing. [Redacted] is heard saying that wasn't him, implying he did not make the comment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'[Redacted] and [redacted] then got into a verbal argument with Beal regarding what took place. Beal is heard on the video saying, this is his job, and he takes it seriously. [Redacted] is heard apologizing, implying he did not intend to offend him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Further investigation was conducted. Assisting officers made contact with Away Security and checked for surveillance video from inside the Away in the tunnel area. There was a camera pointing towards the visitor's locker room. The video shows Beal turning back around after hearing the comment but goes off screen when the incident occurs.'</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/sport/nba/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>A Magic spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'We are aware of the situation and OPD (Orlando Police Department) has taken jurisdiction of the alleged incident.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Similarly, Wizards spokespeople declined to comment to DailyMail.com: 'We are aware of the situation regarding Bradley Beal in Orlando but won't have further comment until we've gathered more information.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The game was a poor one for Beal, a 29-year-old who has averaged 23.2 points a game for the season.
