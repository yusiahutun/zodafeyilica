And it was for a purpose, I swear. For journalism.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It all started a few months ago when my good friend texted me a photo of<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> Smokiez Delta-8 THC Gummies</a> and asked if I had tried them before. This friend is sober, mind you — and the person who sold her the gummies said that Delta-8 THC was like CBD in that it wouldn't get you high at all. My initial reaction was, "Sounds fake but OK," and tried to do some Googling but came up short.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And then I started seeing Delta-8 THC — aka "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the next big thing in weed</a>" — everywhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, the aforementioned Smokiez gummies had become so popular that they were sold out at the first dispensary I visited (I had to drive to a different county to get them). While inherently, Delta-8 has been around since the dawn of time (the dawn of cannabis's time, at least), it's experienced a huge surge in popularity due to the Farm Bill, a loophole, and the desire to access any form of cannabis despite government red tape (more on that later). And it isn't just in-demand on the coasts: a variety of Delta-8 products can be found in places like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dallas</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Michigan</a>, and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>bakery in Chicago is even putting Delta-8 into cookies</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, you need to know everything about this new "light" weed, including if it's more like CBD or regular 'ol weed with new marketing — and whether or not you should give Delta-8 THC a go.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-delta-8-thc></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Delta-8 THC?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are a lot of compounds in the cannabis plant, including flavonoids, terpenes, and cannabinoids. Of the cannabinoids, you're likely already familiar with at least two: CBD and THC. But it gets more complicated with THC, as evidently, there are different varieties.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The THC most of us are familiar with, or "normal" THC, is known as delta-9-tetrahydracannabinol or Delta-9-THC. Delta-9's sibling — fraternal twin, perhaps? — Delta-8 THC (delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol) is "chemically nearly identical to Delta-9," says Benjamin Caplan, M.D., board-certified family physician, cannabis physician, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>founder of CED Clinic</a>. "It's the chemical equivalent of right-handedness versus left-handedness on the molecule. A natural variant; like different eye color." While this may seem like a trivial distinction, according to Dr. Caplan, this structural difference "gives the two molecules starkly different effects in the body."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also of note: Delta-8 is often sourced from hemp, which is a type of cannabis plant. "Cannabis and hemp are different varieties of the same species," explains Robert Flannery, Ph.D., <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CEO of Dr. Robb Farms</a> and the first Ph.D. in the U.S. with certified technical expertise in growing commercial cannabis. "It's like saying a red rose versus a white rose. They aren't all that different."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-so-how-does-delta-8-compare-to-regular-thc></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>So, How Does Delta-8 Compare to "Regular" THC?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The biggest differentiator in the marketing of Delta-8 THC vs. Delta-9 (or "regular") THC is that it reportedly "doesn't get you high." When I asked a budtender at a San Diego dispensary for her opinion — she told me, "It's somewhere between CBD and THC in its effects," noting that it wouldn't get me high high, but it'd have a little more punch than a CBD gummy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Delta-8 can be taken, absorbed, and processed in similar ways as its twin-brother, Delta-9, but it does have some different properties," says Dr. Caplan. "Delta-8 is felt to be less euphoric, less stimulating of appetite, and to many, it is felt to be a less potent version of Delta-9."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for whether or not Delta-8 has less of the anxiety-inducing potential of Delta-9 — a lot of this is marketing. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Caplan says</a> this entirely depends on the patient, their unique reaction, and their own endocannabinoid system (ECS).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Flannery echoes Dr. Caplan: "Since Delta-8 has a different shape than Delta-9 THC, it binds less intensely to the receptors in the endocannabinoid system," he says. "This means that more Delta-8 THC is necessary to feel the same intensity of a high as Delta-9 THC." He notes that you will still feel similar effects: stimulated appetite, analgesic properties, euphoria, psychoactivity, muscle relaxation, etc.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But it also depends on the form you're taking, according to Dr. Flannery, who says the edibles may pack more of a punch. "It does seem like Delta-8 THC, when consumed as an edible, acts differently than when it is inhaled," he says. "When eaten, Delta-8 THC acts more like Delta-9 THC. The concentration needed to medicate will be roughly the same between the two isomers of THC."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, if you are more comfortable with inhaling cannabis, you may get the mellower effects through this delivery. The edible consumption of Delta-8 seems to be almost equally as potent as Delta-9 compared to equal doses.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-does-delta-8-still-get-you-high></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Does Delta-8 Still Get You High?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It can. In my case, absolutely. For the sake of this story, I tried five milligram doses of a Delta-8 THC gummy three separate times to ensure the first time wasn't a fluke. So here's how Delta-8 might feel, depending on your own unique experience and cannabis use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For reference, since I'm your control group: I'm a lightweight in every capacity, so five milligrams of conventional THC in a gummy will have me roaming the astral plane, so to speak. The last time I had an edible at this dose (of conventional Delta-9 THC), I left my phone in the refrigerator. I wandered around looking for it and then watched an hour of Minecraft YouTube with my friend's eight-year-old kid while eating a family-sized bag of peanut butter M&Ms. Classic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So as for my experience with the same dose of Delta-8? Rather similar. It involved a lot of Oreo Os cereal and singing the Eurovision soundtrack. I laughed until I was crying, for no reason in particular. Pretty standard stuff. I tried it again twice at the same dose (1/5th of the 25mg gummy) and had a similar experience each time. Last night I got the same warm-and-fuzzy body feeling, was very smiley, and then texted my family group chats, "I have to go to bed because my dog is mad at me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I have two friends who are more of the heavyweight variety when it comes to cannabis, who took the entire 25mg gummy and were absolutely fine; one was "mildly high" but normally functioning and clear-minded, and the other "felt nothing but relaxed" with no high at all. My sober friend, unfortunately, fell into my category (the stoney baloney category). She said, "I felt like I was floating," and that the employees at the store were "in awe" that she felt anything.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What does this mean for you? If you're going to partake in Delta-8, be prepared to at least be mildly intoxicated. Everyone's body is different, and you could have a vastly different experience than someone else you know.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-delta-8-thc-even-legal></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is Delta-8 THC Even Legal?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Federally, no. It's been a topic of legal contention recently, though. Specifically, with Delta-8, there's been a lot of confusion due to the nature of its sourcing and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Farm Bill, which legalizes hemp</a> but not THC.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Currently, the legality of Delta-8 is questionable since, in the US, most of it is [derived] from hemp, which is legal," says Jessica Peatross, M.D., internist, Gerson therapist,<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> and functional medicine leader</a>. "So this area is hazy in many states." However, on a federal level, "The DEA recently clarified its position on Delta-8 in an addendum to the Farm Bill," she says. "The addendum redefines all THC by saying it's illegal to synthetically produce THC in any form, including Delta-8."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If a vendor of Delta-8 says otherwise, they're essentially exploiting a loophole. "Delta-8 THC is technically not the banned Delta-9 THC," explains Dr. Caplan. "So, in this way, companies are taking advantage of the government's ignorance of the situation, and selling Delta-8 under the Farm Bill, by postal mail, as a 'THC-light' sort of option. The FDA has caught wind of what's happening, and they are already starting to issue cease and desist notices to some of these companies, but surely not all."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As of now, legality is contingent on your state's own cannabis laws.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I mean, sure! If it's legal for you, and you enjoy cannabis or use it as a therapeutic, definitely give it a shot. But is there a reason to use this variety of cannabinoids over the others? Not necessarily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Caplan says that while scientific evidence supporting Delta-8 (and looking at its effects compared to Delta-9) does exist, it's scant and sometimes conflicting. "Most of the studies are in animals," explains Dr. Peatross. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Citing a 2004 study on Delta-8 THC</a> in mice and its effect on appetite regulation, she shared that this cannabinoid showed "increased appetite and improved cognitive function without the effects typically linked to cannabis" and that "Delta-8 might be a 'potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of weight disorders.'" Another study Dr. Peatross pointed to found that Delta 8-THC was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>linked to pain relief in rats</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you live in a state in which cannabis is legal and easily accessible, this might be an option you'll want to consider, particularly if you're looking for health benefits with (potentially) less intoxication (or, you're fine with being high and just want to try something new). "If people are sensitive to the euphoria of Delta-9 THC and want a less potent version, then Delta-8 might be a pleasant alternative," says Dr. Caplan.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-delta-8-the-new-cbd></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is Delta-8 the New CBD?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In short, no. Not at all. This kind of marketing is disingenuous and lazy at best and dangerous and irresponsible at worst. These two compounds serve different purposes, and as you probably know already, CBD does not get you high on its own. For some, CBD is not enough for their therapeutic needs; for others, it's just right. The same goes for Delta-8 — it's entirely dependent on your goals, needs, woes, and reaction to cannabinoids.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for my experience, I'll keep CBD for my day-in and day-out mood support and inflammation relief and use the rest of these sour watermelon gummies on the nights when I want a couple of glasses of wine, but don't want a hangover. IMO, Delta-8 is a brilliant substitute for just that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWmrcutn2aemam7pr%2FSaJuepKSWenl506GaZqSZnLW1edaenJ0%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdelta-8-thc-light-weed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdelta-8-thc-light-weed.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdelta-8-thc-light-weed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdelta-8-thc-light-weed.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdelta-8-thc-light-weed.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdelta-8-thc-light-weed.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./everything-you-need-to-know-about-retinol.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./everything-you-need-to-know-about-retinol.html></a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ipvsbkgnjxyperu2ud4hrhw-mmjzzlei.html>Watch 48 Hours Season 32 Episode 53: The Killing of Daniel Green</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ipvsbkgnjxyperu2ud4hrhw-mmjzzlei.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
