<time>08 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p class=align-left><strong>As much as fans would like to enjoy a television show for the longest time possible, it is just not possible. Such shows, regardless of genre, come and go, and so do the characters. However, a departure midway or hardly before the culmination of the first season raises eyebrows. <i>Counting Cars</i>, an American reality TV series, is perhaps one of History Channels most amusing. And a fan favourite, the no-nonsense manager of the workshop, Scott Jones, left unceremoniously after the second season. So, what happened to Scott on <i>Counting Cars</i>?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7d408cdf089310d8.jpg><p class=align-left>Reality television shows have an ingenious way of developing interest and connecting with the audience personally. It is like viewing someone going about their daily lives on television, an element that has proven to invoke immense interest from viewers.</p><p class=align-left>And the connection would, of course, be with a particular member of the cast. For <i>Counting Cars</i>, Scott emerged as one of the most interesting. The apparent reason is his no-nonsense approach as the store's manager. His absence after the second season didn't go well with fans that were left wondering what happened. Why did Scott leave <i>Counting Cars</i>?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f18da9befdaee2d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jenny Jones murder updates, documentary, and lawsuit update</span></p></a><h2>Who is Scott Jones?</h2><p class=align-left>Many people are wondering about Scott Jones’ background. What did he do before appearing on the television show as a bookkeeper and administrator of Count’s Kustoms? Unfortunately, not much is known about his background aside from a few details.</p><p class=align-left>Scott worked at a local repair store in Greenville called Kyker’s Extreme Automotive. He often visited Las Vegas to see his then-fiancée (now his wife). Count's Kustoms employed her wife for a brief period.</p><p class=align-left>And it is during such visits that he met <a href=#>Danny</a> Koker. He offered him a job at the car restoration and repair store that eventually led him to become part of the cast of <i>Counting Cars</i>.</p><p class=align-left>Scott maintained the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">store’s accounts</a> and issued approved budgets for new projects. On top of these responsibilities, the famous character monitored <a href=#>profit</a> margins. Although Scott and the boss were constantly at each other's throats, the boss highly commended his bookkeeping skills.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b77049bcccd40ab8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Squid Game: Top Trending Series Rejected for 10 Years before Making Netflix Splash</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Scott Jones was serious about his work and gave the store's employees a hard time if they weren't putting in the required effort. If you have watched the televisions series, you might have noticed Scott's stance on laziness. He further punished his workers by telling them to go down on the floor and do some push-ups.</p><p class=align-left>In the beginning, the store had around ten people, but with Scott’s direction, it grew to more than double the number. This growth showed that Scott’s impeccable bookkeeping skills and capability of staying vigilant at all times brought the <a href=#>business</a> to profitability. This way, it could absorb more employees and expand.</p><h2>What happened to Scott on Counting Cars?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f18da9befdaee2d.jpg><p class=align-left>When the television show's third season premiered, fans were perplexed to realise that Scott Jones was no longer part of the <a href=#>television show</a>. Instead, Kevin Mack replaced him as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">manager of Count’s Kustom</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a77cfb908fdb2317.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Manuel Bellazetin from Kindig-It? Everything you should know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Of course, many fans wondered whether the famous character's boisterous nature had caught up with him. He often argued with his boss. So, what really happened to Scott on <i>Counting Cars</i>?</p><p class=align-left>As expected, fans took to social media to express their concerns about Scott's disappearance from the television show. They brainstormed on several speculation and conspiracies. They missed Scott Jones' <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">eccentric and bossy presence</a> on the televisions show. So, why did Scott leave Counts Kustoms?</p><h3>Allegations of embezzlement</h3><p class=align-left>One of the most widespread speculations about Scott Jones from <i>Counting Cars</i> is that he embezzled funds from the store. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Earned the Necklace</a> made a report claiming that Scott had stolen money from Danny, which was the main reason for his exit. However, the theory of embezzlement is not new to the car restoration store.</p><p class=align-left>In 2017, an employee named Frontiera allegedly stole money close to $75 million from the store. As a result, many fans have speculated that Scott might have followed suit and got discovered later. After all, it was easy for him to steal, considering he is in charge of the store's books.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/15a2b6225ac6e847.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Izzy on Flip or Flop? Everything you should know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is not clear whether Scott embezzled funds from the store. But, if it happened, it is enough of a reason for him to get fired.</p><h3>Maybe going back home</h3><p class=align-left>Another speculation about what happened to Scott on <i>Counting Cars</i> is that he left because of family-related reasons. The theory states that he left the show to be close to his son after his wife gave birth.</p><p class=align-left>If you have been following the television series, you know that Scott's son was born after season 3, episode 1, just about the time he left the TV series.</p><p class=align-left>Scott Jones lived in Las Vegas while on the television show, but he always wanted to reside in Greenville, Tennessee. His <a href=#>family</a> has roots in Tennessee, Georgia, and West Virginia. However, he grew up in a military family, meaning they had to move to different places.</p><h3>Problems with the boss</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0bf4342c17f2a948.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How did Flip from Street Outlaws die? The full tragic story</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The idea of having problems with his boss is one of the most easily believable, considering their frequent arguments. They had numerous misunderstandings. They debated virtually anything, including deadlines, projects and more.</p><p class=align-left>It is possible that Scott Jones pushed the boss too far with his personality. Maybe it was sufficient for him to get kicked out of the <a href=#>car </a>restorations store.</p><h3>Tired of the camera</h3><p class=align-left>The cast of <i>Counting Cars</i> are followed by cameras everywhere they go, and it might be not very pleasant sometimes. Some fans have speculated that Scott Jones might have gotten tired of filming.</p><h3>Business interests</h3><p class=align-left>Some fans have theorised that Scott Jones opened his care restoration store after moving to Tennessee. Maybe having his <a href=#>business</a> and family nearby made him leave the popular television show.</p><h2>What is Scott Jones up to today?</h2><p class=align-left>Scott Jones from<i> Counting Cars</i> lives a private life. He is not active on social media. He has a Twitter account that he hardly updates. Therefore, it is hard knowing what he is doing today. However, he is likely running his garage in Tennessee and spending time with his family.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d14aebe03f9aabe4.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Graveyard Carz cast changes: The real reason main characters left</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Until today, fans are wondering what happened to Scott from <i>Counting Cars</i>.
