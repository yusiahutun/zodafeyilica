During the chat, he talked about the similarities between himself and <a href=#>TV</a> host Nick Cannon.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1808820980-811x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-eddie-murphy-have-any-fatherly-advice-for-nick-cannon>Does Eddie Murphy have any fatherly advice for Nick Cannon?</h2><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> star opened up about Christmas with his 10 children, whom he shares with five different women.</p><p>He said: “I go all-out on Christmas. I got 10 kids, and all the family comes around, and it’s just a house full of people. That’s my favorite dish.”</p><p>Some have made comparisons between Eddie Murphy and Nick Cannon for the amount of children that they both have – with Nick having had a number of his within the span of three years.</p><p>When he was asked if he had any advice, Eddie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied</a>: “Lord have mercy, yeah, no.”</p><p>He simply said: “He don’t need no advice.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Will and Jada Smith will ‘stay together forever’ in bombshell marriage update</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-eddie-murphy-loves-being-a-dad>Eddie Murphy ‘loves’ being a dad</h2><p>The 62-year-old has previously spoken about how much he loves being a dad and says that he doesn’t have “one bad seed.”</p><p>In an episode on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast, which was recorded in 2021, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “I am going to be 60 in April and I have all these babies. I love fatherhood.</p><p>“The whole idea of being out there and doing three movies a year, that s*** is over… I found over and over again, and along the way I realized that if you put your children first you never make a bad decision.”</p><p>He continued: “When you hit a crossroads moment or you have got some s**t , you think, ‘Well, what is best for my children?’ If you go that route, then you never make a bad decision.”</p><p>The Shrek star went on to praise his children and said he got “really lucky.”</p><p>He said: “I am so blessed with my kids.”</p><p>“I don’t have one bad seed. I don’t have any like ‘Oh you are the one.’ I don’t have any of that. My kids are so great, normal people – and nobody is like the Hollywood jerk kid.</p><p>“My kids are smart and are trying to do stuff. I am blessed with my kids. I really, really got lucky.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-saint-nick-is-ready-to-spend-christmas-with-his-12-children>‘Saint Nick’ is ready to spend Christmas with his 12 children</h2><p>Talking to Entertainment Tonight while at the Soul Train Music Awards in Los Angeles on Monday (November 27) about his Christmas plans, Nick Cannon seemed to in similar spirits to Eddie Murphy. He was also excited about spending the festive season with his children.</p><p>“Saint Nick will be in every chimney I could possibly be in. It’s all about the kids so, you’ll definitely see us doing some fun, over the top stuff in the next 30 days,” Nick <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>Earlier this year, the 43-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> People he “understands” if people aren’t a fan of his “lifestyle.”</p><p>“I understand that my lifestyle isn’t typical to society and can be viewed as unorthodox in some ways. But my goal in life is just to love my kids and be there for my kids and provide for them. Like I always say, I just love with abundance.”</p><p>Much like Eddie, Nick puts his children first. “Fatherhood is my number one and first priority when I open my eyes, when I get up every morning. Career and work and all of that, take second.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Chadwick Boseman’s agent on why he kept cancer diagnosis a secret – ‘he was a very private person’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2eGcLLArZ%2Beql2ks259j2acnZyZmnquwdGpn7JlmJbAbrLIr5xmr5%2BnsbR5xaipZp6RqbWmvoyonWZpYmK7qq%2FKZpqapp6ku27Ax6KqZpuYp7a0wMyaqmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffather-of-10-eddie-murphy-has-five-words-for-father-of-12-nick-cannon-this-christmas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffather-of-10-eddie-murphy-has-five-words-for-father-of-12-nick-cannon-this-christmas.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffather-of-10-eddie-murphy-has-five-words-for-father-of-12-nick-cannon-this-christmas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffather-of-10-eddie-murphy-has-five-words-for-father-of-12-nick-cannon-this-christmas.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffather-of-10-eddie-murphy-has-five-words-for-father-of-12-nick-cannon-this-christmas.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffather-of-10-eddie-murphy-has-five-words-for-father-of-12-nick-cannon-this-christmas.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ravendere-retreats-wildwood-spa-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ravendere-retreats-wildwood-spa-review.html>Extraordinary Escapes with Sandi Toksvig - why Wildwood Spa is the perfect romantic getaway</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./43-facts-about-mumford-sons.html>43 Facts About Mumford Sons</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./43-facts-about-mumford-sons.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
