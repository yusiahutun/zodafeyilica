He adds: 'It is standard practice to inject a minuscule amount of filler into the tip of the nose at the end of the treatment, to stop it appearing like it points downwards.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But injecting filler into only the tip of the nose is not usually a standalone treatment.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Paul Banwell, a Harley Street plastic surgeon and an expert in safe aesthetic practice, says: 'No reputable, professional medical practitioner would perform this treatment. Not only because it gives an unnatural look, but also because there are extensive risks.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Experts say that the aesthetic has been popularised by face-modifying filters on smartphone apps such as Instagram that digitally tweak and enhance selfies, slimming and upturning the nose and sucking in the cheeks.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We are starting to see people looking for exaggerated features they've seen on an Instagram filter,' says Dr Esho. 'People don't realise it looks weird in real life.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some patients have taken to social media to warn others of the downsides of the Tinkerbell tip lift, having suffered complications.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One, personal trainer Kristin Lynn, posted a video to her TikTok channel showing gruesome scabs on the tip of her nose that developed in the days after she had filler injections, when the body tissue started to die due to lack of blood supply, known as necrosis.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I woke up a couple of days later and my nose was swollen,' she wrote. 'My eyes were black and blue, my lips were swollen. Then I started to blister, and the skin on my nose started to die.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kristin returned to the nurse who had injected the filler, who then administered a drug that dissolved it instantly – but the problem didn't go away.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It took months for this damaged skin to heal,' she says. 'The moral of the story is be careful what you inject into your face.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some medical cosmetics practitioners say caution should be taken with all non-surgical nose jobs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Emily Mehta, a cosmetics doctor and medical director of Story clinics, says: 'I try to avoid doing non-surgical nose jobs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The nose is the most risky part of the face when it comes to injecting filler, because of the high density of tiny arteries.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'People think that it is a low-risk alternative to surgery but, considering you need to have top-ups every ten months, the risks of the injections add up over time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You can mitigate some of this by going to an experienced medical professional. But, sadly, most people don't go to reputable places.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We recently had a client who had a tip lift done by a beautician and ended up with a blood-vessel blockage. We had to send her to hospital as she was suffering from necrosis. I hope they were able to save her nose.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Earlier this year the Government announced plans for tightened regulations on performing non-surgical treatments, but Ministers have yet to produce a timetable or details of enforcement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCVlrm1tI6aqa2hk6Gybn2PcG1tbGhufJW0xGaLoqabmr%2BjsculZI2hoGKZqrLTZqOemZRir6210q2cq52UYsCstc1mmaWhnpm7pr%2FSZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-tinkerbell-tip-lift-lead-blistered-skin-blindness-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-tinkerbell-tip-lift-lead-blistered-skin-blindness-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-tinkerbell-tip-lift-lead-blistered-skin-blindness-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-tinkerbell-tip-lift-lead-blistered-skin-blindness-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-tinkerbell-tip-lift-lead-blistered-skin-blindness-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-tinkerbell-tip-lift-lead-blistered-skin-blindness-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./weride-raise-investment-next-generation-autonomous-driving-tech-beijing-seeks-cut-manufacturers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./weride-raise-investment-next-generation-autonomous-driving-tech-beijing-seeks-cut-manufacturers.html>WeRide to raise investment in next-generation autonomous driving tech as Beijing seeks to cut manufa</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./terry-j-lundgren.html>Terry J.
