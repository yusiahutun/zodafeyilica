Brady, who holds the record for the most Super Bowl wins in NFL history, is the quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and shares three kids with his wife Gisele Bündchen and his ex-girlfriend <a href=# id=auto-tag_bridget-moynahan data-tag=bridget-moynahan>Bridget Moynahan</a>.</p><p>Moynahan, an actress best known for her role on Blue Bloods, dated Brady from 2004 to 2006. Moynahan’s representative confirmed their split to People, telling the magazine that the two broke up “amicably.” “[They] amicably ended their three-year relationship several weeks ago. We ask for your respect and consideration of their privacy,” the statement read. That same year, Brady started <a href=# rel=noopener>dating Bündchen</a>, a <a href=# rel=noopener>Victoria’s Secret angel</a> at the time, whom a mutual friend introduced him to on a blind date. “I knew right way–the first time I saw him,” the model told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Vanity Fair</a> in 2009, describing Brady’s “beautiful, charismatic smile” and how they talked for three hours.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lombardi-trophy.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tom-Brady-2.jpg><p>A few months into <a href=# rel=noopener>Bündchen and Brady’s relationship</a>, Moynahan announced that she was pregnant with Brady’s baby. She gave birth to their son, John Edward Thomas Moynahan, in August 2007. Two years after his first child’s birth, <a href=# rel=noopener>Brady married Bündchen</a> in a small wedding at St. Monica Catholic Church in Santa Monica, California. The two had a second wedding in Costa Rica a few months later. Bündchen and Brady welcomed their first child together, a son named Benjamin Rein, in 2009. Their second child, a daughter named Vivian Lake, was born in 2012.</p><p>In her interview with Vanity Fair, Bündchen opened up about the moment she learned that Moynahan was pregnant with Brady’s child.&nbsp;“In the beginning you’re living this romantic fantasy; you’re thinking, this can’t be true, it’s so good,” she said at the time. “And then, whoops—wake-up call! We were dating two and a half months when he found out, and it was a very challenging situation. Obviously, in the beginning, it’s not the ideal thing.” The model went on to reveal that she considered leaving Brady due to the situation.&nbsp;“You question at times–‘Should I stay here? Maybe you should work this out,'” she said.</p><p>However, as time went on, Brady, Bündchen and Moynahan found a way to make their family work. A source told Page Six in February 2021 that Moynahan and Bündchen now talk about as often as Brady and his ex. “Tom and I made a decision to raise a child together and we both found partners that not only supported us in raising that child, but also loved our child as if he was their own,” Moynahan told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2019. “I don’t think you can ask for more than that. My son is surrounded by love.”</p><p>So that’s Bündchen, Brady and Moynahan’s relationship in a nutshell. To find out more about <a href=# rel=noopener>Tom Brady’s kids</a>—John, Benjamin and Vivian—read on. Their family couldn’t get any cuter.</p><p>Read on to meet Tom Brady’s kids and children with Gisele Bündchen and Bridget Moynahan.</p><h2>John “Jack” Moynahan</h2><p>Born: August 22, 2007</p><p>Jack, whose full name is John Edward Thomas Moynahan, is Brady’s first child and the only kid he shares with his ex-girlfriend, Bridget Moynahan. Brady’s wife, Gisele Bündchen, calls Jack her “bonus son.” In an interview with More magazine in 2011, Moynahan revealed that Brady wasn’t in the delivery room with her when she gave birth. “He was there on that day and came in afterwards. He certainly wasn’t holding my hand while I pushed,” she said.</p><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2020 that Brady’s eldest son “loves football” and has already taken an interest in playing. “Tom and Jack are super tight,” the source said. “He loves football. Tom’s very active with him. He’s always spotted out with him. Parents have seen him playing football in the schoolyard with Jack and his classmates.”</p><p>In an interview on The Howard Stern Show in 2020, Brady opened up about whether he would want his children to be athletes like him. “I would never want for them to be ‘Tom Brady’s son’ playing football. I don’t like that at all,” he said. “But from a team, camaraderie, discipline, I think there’s something about contact sports that teaches you a lot about discipline, respect, mutual respect for your opponent that you don’t get in non-contact sports.”</p><h2>Benjamin Brady</h2><p>Born: December 8, 2009</p><p>Benjamin, whose is nicknamed Benny, is Brady’s second son and his first child with Bündchen. In an interview with Men’s Health in 2019, Brady said it was “hard” when Benny, whose full name is Benjamin Rein Brady, told him that he isn’t interested in sports, unlike his half-brother, Jack. “He wants to try hard, and he never wants to disappoint his dad,” Brady said. “Gisele kept saying to me, ‘Would you effing understand that your son is different? The reality is that Benny just likes different things. And it’s great because now I just have to go do what he wants to do. When we do that, we have the best time. He’s like, ‘OMG, Dad, you’re so funny.’ He loves joking, and I joke back.”</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post for Benny’s 9th birthday in 2018, Brady described his middle child as a “beautiful, loving, sweet son.” “Our sweet Benny, 9 years ago you were born and what a blessing you have been. You are such a beautiful, loving, sweet son that we always knew you would be!” he wrote. “We are lucky parents to have you in our life and you always put a smile on everyone’s face when you are around! First present is some bigger boxing gloves because I can’t take those shots anymore! 🤣❤️💯”</p><h2>Vivian Brady</h2><p>Born: December 5, 2012</p><p>Vivian’s full name is Vivian Lake Brady. She is Brady’s only daughter and his second child with Bündchen. Vivian, who’s been described as Bündchen look-alike, recreated her model mom’s Vogue cover in January 2021. In an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post shared by the model, Vivian posed on a horse exactly like her mom did for Vogue when she was 20 years old. In December 2020, Brady wished his daughter a happy 8th birthday on Instagram with a photo of her and Benny. “HBD 8th birthday Vivi! You are the sweetest little girl a daddy could ever hope for! You are so loved (and always protected by your big brothers)! ❤️” he wrote.</p><p>What is Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen’s custody agreement? Tom and Gisele filed for divorce after 13 years of marriage on October 28, 2022. Gisele filed for divorce from Tom on October 28, 2022, in Florida, which Tom didn’t contest. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> reported at the time that Tom and Gisele reached an agreement on their shared property and child custody. Though the settlement will remain confidential, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> that the couple agreed on joint custody of their children. “The settlement is all worked out,”the insider said. “They’ve been working on the terms this whole time.” The source added, “They agreed to joint custody of the kids.”</p><p>Tom and Gisele confirmed their divorce on October 28, 2022, with separate statements on their Instagram Stories. Tom’s statement read: “In recent days, my wife and I finalized our divorce from one another after 13 years of marriage. We arrived at this decision amicably and with gratitude for the time we spent together. We are blessed with beautiful and wonderful children who will continue to be the center of our world in every way. We will continue to work together as parents to always ensure they receive the love and attention they deserve.”</p><p>His statement continued, “We arrived at this decision to end our marriage after much consideration. Doing so is, of course, painful and difficult like it is for many people who go through the same thing every day around the world. However we wish only the best for each other as we pursue whatever new chapters in our lives that are yet to be written. And we kindly ask for privacy and respect as we navigate what is to come in the days and weeks ahead. Thank you.”</p><p>Gisele’s statement read: “With much gratitude for our time together, Tom and I have amicably finalized our divorce. My priority has always been and will continue to be our children whom I love with all my heart. We will continue co-parenting to give them the love, care and attention they greatly deserve.” She continued, “The decision to end a marriage is never easy, but we have grown apart and while it is, of course, difficult to go through something like this, I feel blessed for the time we had together and only wish the best or Tom always. I kindly ask that our privacy be respected during this sensitive time. Thank you. Gisele.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Elle</a> in 2022, Gisele opened up about how she took a break from her modeling career to support Tom and their children. “I’ve done my part, which is [to] be there for [Brady]. I moved to Boston, and I focused on creating a cocoon and a loving environment for my children to grow up in and to be there supporting him and his dreams,” she said. “Seeing my children succeed and become the beautiful little humans that they are, seeing [Brady] succeed, and being fulfilled in his career—it makes me happy. At this point in my life, I feel like I’ve done a good job on that.” Gisele also told Elle at the time that, now that her children are older, she plans to get back to her career.&nbsp; “I have a huge list of things that I have to do, that I want to do. At 42, I feel more connected with my purpose,” she said.</p><p>Still, Gisele didn’t regret the time she spent with her children and explained she was “so grateful” to have been a part of “really shaping who [her kids] are as people.” “I feel very fulfilled in that way, as a mother and as a wife,” she said. “And now it’s going to be my turn. It’s not like I’m going to be in the valley forever.” Gisele also told Elle that she wished Tom was “more present” in her children’s lives. “Obviously, I have my concerns—this is a very violent sport, and I have my children and I would like him to be more present,” she said of her then-husband. “I have definitely had those conversations with him over and over again. But ultimately, I feel that everybody has to make a decision that works for [them]. He needs to follow his joy, too.”</p><p>In Tom’s 2021 documentary Man in the Arena, Gisele also explained that she chose to take a “back seat” in her career so that Tom could focus on his. “I want him to be very fulfilled. I felt like very fulfilled in my career, so I felt like I was okay to kind of take the back seat, and I wanted him to have all the room that he needed to perform at his best because I knew that he wasn’t going to be happy if he didn’t,” she said. Tom, for his part, told producers of the documentary, which aired a year before his and Gisele’s divorce, about how he and his then-wife were able to overcome so many “ups and downs.” “We found each other at the right time. We’ve been through a lot of ups and downs together, and in so many ways, that’s kind of built our relationship so strong,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-TB-Method-Tom-Brady.jpg><p>For more about Tom Brady, read his book, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The TB12 Method</a>.
