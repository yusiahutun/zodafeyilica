DreamCam is one company which broadcasts videos of adult stars who talk and interact with the audience. Clients can also tip and influence what they do.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's like you're actually having sex with other people but without the fear of getting caught or being seen at a lap dancing club - which my wife forbids', one man told me.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another company has created a small canister that attaches to VR headsets and releases a sweet, musty scent during the action. There are also sex toys for men that can be synced to the video, allowing them to physically feel what they're watching the person on screen do.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I am pro porn if it's ethical and used in moderation and in the right way.

If you’ve noticed the odd search of porn when you (accidentally, of course) click on the history button, don’t give it another thought.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Are you still having sex?</span> Porn sex is lazy sex. Most men have a few favourite sites and a particular type of porn they know will push all the right buttons. If you’re still having enjoyable, regular sex, his solo sessions with porn are nothing to worry about. It’s when he’d rather watch porn and masturbate than have real life sex with you when alarms should ring.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>So why would he opt for porn over sex with me? </span>It’s quick, it’s easy and it’s ready when he is. Zero effort required. Porn isn’t affected by periods, fat days, moods or arguments. It’s predictable – people aren’t. If he has any erection issues and is embarrassed about them, he might opt for porn rather than have what he sees as an excruciating conversation. Ditto if he premature ejaculates.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>How much time is he spending watching it?</span> Most studies indicate that men watch around 70 minutes of per week with each session lasting about five to fifteen minutes. If your partner’s clocking up way more than that, you might well have a problem.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A good sex therapist or therapist who specialises in addiction can help solve the problem and there are many dedicated porn addiction clinics world-wide as well.&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/femail/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>The user isn't just an observer, they're a participant. The scenes can be so lifelike, you get lost in them and mistake them for reality.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This type of activity produces a pleasure-inducing dopamine release that makes users keep coming back for more.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In short: it threatens to be far more addictive than 'normal' porn.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>VR porn is both effortless and highly satisfying. Faced with the choice of solving a sex problem with a real life partner – something that requires effort, motivation and good communication - or putting on a headset to get your kicks, there are no prizes for guessing what many men will opt for.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It's new, exciting and can make real life connections feel second rate. 'To be honest, I struggle to get an erection with my partner if I've been watching it too much,' another man told me. 'Sex feels dull and colourless.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox">What about the ethical issues?</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Clients with cash can customise avatars to look exactly how they desire. That might be an avatar that looks like an ex they never quite got over. Or someone they can't have but fantasise about. Someone who is sexually off limits: a boss, your best friend's partner. Some men ask for avatars of their girlfriend or wife because they can then make them do something they won't do in real life.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If that's all sounding decidedly creepy and distasteful, that's because it is! Revenge porn could be even more devastating for its victims.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It's not all bad news though.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox">VR porn could have lots of pluses</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lots of couples already enjoy watching VR porn together for an enhanced erotic experience. It's also a great way to explore a new kink before trying it for real (or to satisfy one that your partner doesn't enjoy, without going outside the relationship).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Always wanted to go to a sex party or experience a threesome? Here's your chance to give it a whirl, without the emotional risk to your relationship.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I struggled to find women who use VR porn on a regular basic but the few I did speak to, did it with a partner and loved the experience.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some sex therapists and educators are hoping the new technology will help people solve common sex problems.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'How-to' videos could demonstrate sexual techniques; there could be 'classes' teaching women how to masturbate.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Preliminary research found VR porn results in much greater arousal compared to the traditional 2D view, so it could be useful for people with low libidos.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the future we will be able to have VR sex with our partners.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This will give a much-needed sexual boost to lovers in long distance relationships and make lockdowns and quarantines a whole lot more bearable. Even if you are together physically, it means you can still have sex even if one person doesn't feel well or simply doesn't feel like it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In moderation and especially for people who find it difficult to have sex in real life or can't find someone to have sex with, VR porn is a great way for them to experiment and feel less alone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some experts believe it makes sex so satisfying, men who find it hard to connect with women in real life, might give up completely and happily settle for VR porn as a substitute for real life experiences.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Whichever way you look at it, VR porn – like all porn – is here to stay. It's up to us, as individuals, to navigate our way through the ups and downs and learn to live with it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Visit traceycox.com for Tracey's two products ranges, her podcast, sex advice and her books.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2PaW9tbWJofJW%2BwJycsmVzpMVuv8CyqmaumafBtq3LZqmemZyewbp5z6ipp2WepL%2BueZFpaW9mmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftracey-cox-says-virtual-reality-porn-norm-2026-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftracey-cox-says-virtual-reality-porn-norm-2026-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftracey-cox-says-virtual-reality-porn-norm-2026-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftracey-cox-says-virtual-reality-porn-norm-2026-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftracey-cox-says-virtual-reality-porn-norm-2026-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftracey-cox-says-virtual-reality-porn-norm-2026-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./taylor-schabusiness-police-interview-forgot-lovers-decapitated-head.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./taylor-schabusiness-police-interview-forgot-lovers-decapitated-head.html>Accused Killer Exclaims 'I Got Lazy,' Accidentally Left Lover's Head Behind While Describing Grisly</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./katie-holmes-childhood-throwback-photo-108023.html>So Vintage!Katie Holmes Shares a Fun Childhood Throwback Photo See the Pic!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./katie-holmes-childhood-throwback-photo-108023.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
