In her words,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He was so kind, and loving, and stable and different.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Bridget Phetasy talking about how she met her husband (Source: YouTube)</strong></p><p>Despite tremendous love between the two, they remained apart for a while&nbsp;as the situation was not in their favor.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When she met him, she had just come out of the rot and was beginning to reinvent her life and, prioritizing her love life did not seem to be a good idea for the direction she was headed to.</p><p>Justifying her time apart from her husband, she said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>My first year[of sobriety], I was single, and I needed that. I needed to be uncomfortable with myself. I needed that time to focus on myself, and I felt that I was taking that from him...and I felt like our only chance was really if we took a break.</p><p>Well, the separation was not easy, but it did lead to their togetherness again. After almost fifteen months of separation, the two reconnected, never to leave each other’s side&nbsp;ever again.</p><p>Without further delay, Bridget and her husband tied the knot in November 2020 and later spent their honeymoon in Africa. Bridget calls her wedding the right decision.</p><p>Indeed taking a break did let the two have enough time to reflect on their own life and come back together with a more robust relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Bridget Talks About Marriage And Family</h2><p>Bridget, who is also a writer, has eloquently expressed her thoughts on marriage and men. Having been married twice and been in a few relationships in the past, she has her share of experience on the forte of love and heartbreaks.</p><p>In an article in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Medium</a>, she writes how she wished she had someone to talk her out of getting married young. But, unfortunately, her relationship with her first husband, with whom she eloped, did not last long.</p><p>Doing her own survey among her Twitter followers on things they wished they knew before marriage, she prepared a list of some vital tips to sustain a relationship and build lasting family relationships. Some of her pointers on relationships go as follows,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“Do it for the right reasons, all great relationships require effort, finances fuel fights, know your partner…”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Her understanding of the relationship partially also comes from the troubled relationship between her parents, who divorced while she was at the age of eleven.</p><p>With all the knowledge on sustaining a marriage, Bridget’s journey with her current husband will probably be smooth sailing.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Phetasy's Net Worth</h2><p>While Bridget Phetasy, age 43, found herself in a stable relationship, her career, on the other hand, is also gradually on the rise.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The Ivy League graduate who refers to herself as a comedian on her social media bio is a podcast host of Walk-Ins Welcome. At the same time, she also runs the show Dumpster Fire with Bridget Phetasy.</p><p>No wonder she earns an impressive net worth from her podcast and show. Further adding to her sources is her YouTube channel which has 49 thousand subscribers as of 2021. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Besides, her merch sales also somewhat add to her fortune.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunC8jpupopyXmsFuvMeeq5qrqWK1tr%2FBmqWdZZGcsm66xK1ksKeiqbVvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbridget-phetasy-husband-age-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbridget-phetasy-husband-age-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbridget-phetasy-husband-age-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbridget-phetasy-husband-age-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbridget-phetasy-husband-age-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbridget-phetasy-husband-age-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dropkick-murphys-announce-new-acoustic-album-this-machine-still-kills-fascists-bringing-woody-guthries-words-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dropkick-murphys-announce-new-acoustic-album-this-machine-still-kills-fascists-bringing-woody-guthries-words-life.html>Dropkick Murphys Announce New Acoustic Album This Machine Still Kills Fascists Bringing Woody</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lewis-smith.html>Who is Lewis Smith dating?
