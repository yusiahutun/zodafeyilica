A spontaneous engagement, their battle with cancer, and given how good they look together, it’s only fair that the duo should get a happy ending.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But are Dominique Crenn and her partner Maria Bello married? And what’s going on with their relationship today? Find the answer as you scroll down.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Are Dominique Crenn And Her Partner Maria Bello Married?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sadly no, Dominique Crenn and her partner Maria Bello aren’t married as of 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Maria, they were “pretty happy” leading lives as fiancees. So, they’ve no idea when they’ll actually walk the aisle. However, they did have plans to hold a grand wedding.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“So this is sort of our fun time out in Hollywood for the first time. It was very surprising and meant to be, but about time. I’ve finally grown up enough to get married,” Maria shared after a week of getting engaged.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, the actress added that they were “really excited about this new chapter.” Being with Dominique, doing the same things she was doing, but this time, together with her partner, Maria didn’t want anything more.</span></p><h3><b>When Did Maria Bello And Dominique Crenn Begin Dating?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Maria Bello and Dominique Crenn began dating between late 2018 to early 2019.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Shortly after the pair started seeing each other, Dominique was then diagnosed with breast cancer. She then tried to warn Maria what her cancer would mean for their relationship. But the actress wasn’t letting anything come between them. “She’s like, ‘I’m here and I’m going to be here for all the time during the time of this’ and she’s been by my side. She’s been there for us,” Dominique explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In response, Maria then added, “Listen, I just knew. I just knew and so did she. I’ve never smiled as much as I have this last year.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Maria didn’t hesitate to mention that you really learn how someone rolls when they’re sick. And she loved the way Dominique “rolled through life and danced through life” even when she was really sick. No wonder, she chose her as a future life partner.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>These lovebirds got engaged in December 2019 during a romantic Paris getaway. However, they only revealed the news about their engagement in February 2020 while coupling up on their way to Elton John’s annual Oscar party.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“We’re pretty happy, considering that we just got engaged,” Bello revealed to Entertainment Tonight reporter Lauren Zima at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Dominique beat cancer and was doing well the last we checked.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span style=font-weight:400> Dominique has admitted to being open to loving someone of any sex.</span></p><h3><b>Have Dominique Crenn And Maria Bello Adopted Daughters?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Dominique Crenn and Maria Bello do have their respective children. But it’s unclear if they’ve adopted any together.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking about Dominique’s kids, she has twin daughters named Olivia and Charlotte whom she shared with her ex-partner Katherine Keon. The twin lived with Katherine and turned 8 on May 1, 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On their 8th birthday, Dominique took it to her IG to share a picture of them captioned, “You are my brightest light, and my strength that allow me to work harder for a better world. You are kind, brilliant, conscious and curious. You are the example of a true free human, i love you more than you know. You are my best friends and you both teach me humility. You are what matters in this world. I love you Charlotte and Olivia.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Maria, she has a son named Jackson from her relationship with screenwriter Dan McDermott. And now that Dominique and Maria are engaged, Dominique might also step into a parental role for Maria’s son.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And for anyone wondering if Dominique ever felt like she missed out on being a biological mother herself. Well, she’s happy enough with her “non-biological” kids.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back in 2018, when a man called her out for missing “the very important role of being a mother to children,” she just replied, “If you have kids, I hope you stay home with them, so that your wife can go out and be a bad-ass woman.”</span></p><h3><b>Dominique Crenn Dating History</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Dominique Crenn dated Katherine Keon before Maria Bello. The two co-parented their twin kids and were on good terms even after the breakup.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, though Dominique’s twins often graced her IG @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>officialmariabello</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, she never featured her ex-partner.</span></p><h3><b>Maria Bello Dating History</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Maria Bello has dated quite a few stars.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her first rumored girlfriend was actress Mariska Hargitay (in 1997). However, the two never disclosed their relationship.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 1997, Maria then went on to date the producer Dan McDermott. And together, they welcomed a son named Jackson Blue McDermott on March 5, 2001. Sadly, they split after 7 years in 2006.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>From 2008 to 2010, Maria then dated Bryn Mooser.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2011, Maria then found love again with entrepreneur Clare Munn. The duo embarked on several adventuring including co-founding </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>CQ Matrix Company</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and even writing a book featuring their sexuality. But yet again, Maria was alone after they parted ways in 2016.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Shortly after, in May 2016, Maria then briefly dated Elijah Allan-Blitz.</span></p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmmqqVYrGwucinoKqtlWKws7HNp2SappRitaa%2BjKmYq6yemr9uucCroJplkpq5rbuMppirqpmasXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-dominique-crenn-and-her-partner-maria-bello-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fare-dominique-crenn-and-her-partner-maria-bello-married.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fare-dominique-crenn-and-her-partner-maria-bello-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fare-dominique-crenn-and-her-partner-maria-bello-married.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-dominique-crenn-and-her-partner-maria-bello-married.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-dominique-crenn-and-her-partner-maria-bello-married.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dr-star-jodie-whittaker-films-scenes-new-movie-swimsuit-clad-yael-stone-sydney-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dr-star-jodie-whittaker-films-scenes-new-movie-swimsuit-clad-yael-stone-sydney-html.html>Dr Who star Jodie Whittaker films scenes for her new movie with swimsuit-cladYael Stone in Sydney</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bonnaroo-announces-2020-lineup.html>Bonnaroo Announces 2020 Lineup</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bonnaroo-announces-2020-lineup.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
