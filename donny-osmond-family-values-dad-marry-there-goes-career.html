He said: “There goes your career”’</span></h1><span>Interview by Roz Lewis</span>The singer on growing up in a religious show-business family, lightening up as a dad and being married for 39 years<p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>I am the seventh of nine children,</strong> so when I arrived, there was already Virl, 12; Tom, 10; Alan, eight; Wayne, six; Merrill, four, and Jay, two. We first lived in Ogden, Utah, in a rural area – it had plenty of fields around it and there was a cow and other animals.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>Both my parents were musical</strong> and enjoyed singing. We were a close-knit family. My dad had been an army sergeant and so the house ran along a definite set of rules. My mum was the loving, nurturing parent while my dad was the disciplinarian. Both my parents belonged to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the church’s teachings were a strong influence on all of us.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>We moved to California</strong> when four of my brothers, singing together as the Osmond Brothers Quartet, got a spot on The Andy Williams Show. It was a hugely exciting time for us all. I joined the Osmonds when I was a few days short of my sixth birthday. Marie and Jimmy came along after me and were also added to the singing roster. I&nbsp;think my parents did an incredible job of raising such a large family in what rapidly became a hugely successful show-business family.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>I grew up real fast, real young.</strong> Normality to us was rehearsing hard on new routines and performing on TV shows, plus tours and other performances, with schoolwork via home tutoring squeezed around that schedule.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>At home, away from the public eye,</strong> I’d go to my room and read and build stuff with electronics. I was always curious, inquisitive, wanting to learn how things worked.</p><figure id=5614d75f-19e5-4483-a6cb-568efa56f4c8 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>The Osmonds, with Donny in the yellow shirt.</span> Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</figure><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>My maternal grandfather </strong>was the only grandfather I knew, as my paternal grandfather died when my dad was six months old. He was an amazing man, a college professor with a very brilliant mind, who died when I was about nine. Both my grandmothers lived until I was into my 20s.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>Overall, my dad was my mentor in life,</strong> but musically, it was people like Stevie Wonder and Andy Williams. When I was nine, we opened for Nancy Sinatra, and Frank Sinatra came to the rehearsal and then to the opening night to hear me sing. Elvis Presley was a friend of the family. What I might have missed out on in terms of a “normal” childhood and schooling experiences was more than made up for by these extraordinary musical moments.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>I grew up in the public eye.</strong> While the world knew me as a teen idol, and the Osmonds fame was at its height, I began secretly dating Debbie Glenn. By the time I was 19, I knew I was in love and had to do something right for me. When I told my dad, he said: “Well, there goes your career, but this is ushering in your personal life.”</p><figure id=77e44aa5-cdf1-4771-86ed-e611829e65a7 data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>Donny Osmond: ‘What is my screensaver? Me and my waxwork’Read more</a></figure><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>My dad was right about my career</strong> after I got married. But Debbie is an amazing person to be with. If I hadn’t married her, I’d have been a mess. Now I had someone who understood me and with whom I could build a future together.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>I learned a lot from my parents</strong> about loving your children, treating them with respect and allowing them a voice. Our religion teaches that we are bonded together in eternity, so relationships are very respectful. We value kindness and forgiveness. Debbie and I are religious but not over-fanatical so we have a firm respect for deity, which holds true in our home. I based my parenting style on my dad at first, whom I grew very close to over the years. I think I lightened up as a dad as time went on.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>Debbie and I have been together nearly 39 years.</strong> We have this saying: whenever there is an argument she is always right! She also says that we had five boys but she raised six – and she is still raising me!</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>Family has always been the core of my life. </strong>Four of our sons are now grown and we have eight grandchildren. We all make an effort to have weekends together as a family as often as we can.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Donny Osmond</a>’s The Soundtrack of My life UK Tour 2017 begins on 21 January</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKSZm7KiusOsq7KklWR%2FcX2WaKGapl9nfXCwzqelsmWfqLqwusNmnZqlmaHGbsLApayeq12ZrqV5zJqpq7FdqbWmvsRmnqido2Kwor7Enqk%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdonny-osmond-family-values-dad-marry-there-goes-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdonny-osmond-family-values-dad-marry-there-goes-career.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdonny-osmond-family-values-dad-marry-there-goes-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdonny-osmond-family-values-dad-marry-there-goes-career.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdonny-osmond-family-values-dad-marry-there-goes-career.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdonny-osmond-family-values-dad-marry-there-goes-career.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./elle-macpherson-playboy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./elle-macpherson-playboy.html>Elle Macpherson Recreates 1994 Playboy cover</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mothers-day-crafts-0509.html>66 Easy DIY Mother's Day Gifts 2023</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mothers-day-crafts-0509.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
