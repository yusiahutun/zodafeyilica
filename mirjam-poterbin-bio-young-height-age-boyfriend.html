<time>28 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>It’s only natural for a mother to be protective of her son. But the Basketball star Luka Doncic’s mom Mirjam Poterbin took the meaning of “protectiveness” to whole another level, ready to fight him in the court of law.</span></p><p><span>So, what happened? And who is the wonder child’s mother? Keep reading this Mirjam Poterbin Bio to find out.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Mirjam Poterbin, Luka Doncic Mom</b></h3><p><span>Mirjam Poterbin is Luka Doncic’s mother who won custody of him after divorcing Luka’s father in 2008. She has been a constant face throughout her son’s rise to basketball fame and was often seen supporting Luka from the sidelines in his games.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, following a legal dispute, the two were at odds in 2022.</span></p><h3><b>Why Is Luka Doncic Suing His Mom, Mirjam Poterbin?</b></h3><p><span>It was September 2022 — right after Luka Doncic dropped a record-breaking 47 points on France in the Eurobasket — the news about the basketball star suing his mother Mirjam surfaced.</span></p><p><span>According to Luka, he sued his eponymous brand (owned by his mother for a long time) because he was unable to submit a trademark under his name.</span></p><p><span>Well, that’s pretty understandable for someone like Luka, whose marketability is only likely to grow over time, he’d definitely want to have control of his own brand. “I need to be in control of my brand” because “I continue to improve as a player and as a person,” the star even made an official statement.</span></p><p><span>However, Luka’s mom believed otherwise. Responding with a written message, she wrote, “Everything that is written comes from people who surrounded Luka in the last two years and want complete control over his life and career. I don’t want to wash dirty laundry in public, especially at a time when Luka needs to be collected and focused on the important matches ahead of him.”</span></p><p><span>Also, she added that she’s been taking care of her son “from the moment he was born,” and the only thing that matted to her was Luka’s happiness. And now when there are people “who want to take advantage of him”, Mirjam said that she would “stand behind protecting (her) son and will never deviate from that.”</span></p><p><span>Guess, the contentious legal dispute’s intensifying.</span></p><p><span>But though surprisingly, Luka sued his mother, he revealed that he wasn’t going up against a well-known company or an ex-colleague in business.</span></p><h3><b>Mirjam Poterbin Age</b></h3><p><span>Mirjam Poterbin was 46 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>She is 23 years older than her son.</span></p><h3><b>Mirjam Poterbin Young</b></h3><p><span>They say beauty fades away. But Mirjam Poterbin was as beautiful as she is now when she was young — a little slimmer though.</span></p><p><span>Here is a picture of her from when she competed in Miss Slovenia in 1993.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mirjam-Poterbin-Young-261x300.jpg><p><span>And even today, she’s breaking many hearts with those deep blue eyes.</span></p><h3><b>Does Mirjam Poterbin Have A Boyfriend?</b></h3><p><span>No, Mirjam Poterbin doesn’t have a boyfriend as of 2022. Infact, she has been single ever since her divorce from her ex-husband, Sasa Donic in 2009.</span></p><p><span>Why? Well, after the divorce, rather than focusing on her dating life, Mirjam then dedicated her life to taking care of her son and helping him build a carer in basketball.</span></p><p><span>It was also because Luka decided to play for the NBA Madrid basketball club that Mirjam eventually flew to Spain in 2016.</span></p><p><span>At the time, Mirjam shared, “After Luka was living alone, in residence with other kids in Madrid, I moved to Madrid. Our relationship is very good because he has his own life, I have my own life, but we help each other as much as we can.”</span></p><p><span>Now, talking about Mirjam’s ex-husband, Sasa is a former basketball player and professional coach who last served with </span><i><span>Sentjur</span></i><span> in the Slovenian League. He stands tall at a height of 6 feet 7 inches (200 cm) and has won two Slovenian Premier A League championships and three Slovenian Cups.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span>Luka is Mirjam’s one and only child.</span></p><h3><b>Mirjam Poterbin Height</b></h3><p><span>Mirjam Poterbin stands tall at a ehgitha round 5 feet 8 inches (173 cm).</span></p><p><span>But thanks to her ex-husband’s gene, her son Luka is now 6 feet 6 ¼ inches (198.8 cm).</span></p><p><span>Even on heels, Mirjam looks a lot shorter than her son.</span></p><h3><b>Mirjam Poterbin Job And Career</b></h3><p><span>Mirjam Poterbin is a former model who took part in the Miss Slovenia pageant in 1993. However, after not finding much success, she ended up opening an eponymous beauty salon in Ljubljana, Slovenia, alongside her mother, Milena Poterbin (a </span><i><span>Ljubljana High School of Hairdressing</span></i><span> student).</span></p><p><span>Her hair-and-skin beauty salon was popular amongst the locals and even Miss Earth Slovenia participants visited Mirjam for their hair treatment.</span></p><p><span>Here’s Mirjam Salon’s FB @</span><a href=#><span>Hair and skin beauty salon “MIRJAM”</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>As for Mirjam’s education, she went to</span><i><span> High School for Hospitality and Tourism</span></i><span> in Ljubljana and later graduated from the </span><i><span>University of Ljubljana</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>In 2022, Mirjam’s net worth was above $2 million.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Luka then flaunted a net worth of a stunning $25 million.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Mirjam Poterbin From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Mirjam hails from Ljubljana, Slovenia.</span></p><p><span>But as of 2022, she resided in Dallas, Texas.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Mirjam Poterbin Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Mirjam celebrates her birthday on April 7 and is of the Aries zodiac.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Mirjam Poterbin On Instagram And Facebook?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Yes, find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>mirjampoterbin</span></a><span> and Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>mirjam.poterbin</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s her Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>mirjam_poterbin</span></a><span>.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpqGin66uec%2Boq56qkp67bq7IqGSyp6WjtG60xKKeoaxdlrSmecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmirjam-poterbin-bio-young-height-age-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmirjam-poterbin-bio-young-height-age-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmirjam-poterbin-bio-young-height-age-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmirjam-poterbin-bio-young-height-age-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmirjam-poterbin-bio-young-height-age-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmirjam-poterbin-bio-young-height-age-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./joanna-gaines-coffee-table-home-video-fan-reaction.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./joanna-gaines-coffee-table-home-video-fan-reaction.html>Joanna Gaines' latest home video sparks fan concern</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./brisket-nutritional-facts.html>11 Brisket Nutrition Facts: A Complete Guide to This BBQ Star</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./brisket-nutritional-facts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
