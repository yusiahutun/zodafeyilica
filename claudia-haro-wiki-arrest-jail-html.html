Shocker, isn't it? What happened, what was she accused of, was her husband&nbsp;also involved&nbsp;in this accusation,&nbsp;did she actually end up in jail? These are some of the most heard questions among her followings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Claudia Haro Ended Up In Jail?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Claudia Haro was accused of a murder attempt. To understand the situation more clearly, let's unravel the details one by one, "Garrett&nbsp;Warren,"&nbsp;the victim, in this case, was home one night in May 2000 at his&nbsp;Westlake Village apartment. While he was there, the doorbell started ringing&nbsp;incessantly, and then he heard a&nbsp;man shouting&nbsp;if his silver Volvo was parked in the driveway.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>After six knocks, he opened the door and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;Yeah, this is my car. Did you hit it?</p><p style=text-align:justify>After opening the door, Warren was shot&nbsp;in the chest, neck, left hip, and also in the right eye when he crumbled down after the first three fires.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Hearing the gunshots, Warren's mother ran towards the door, and two shots were fired upon her as well.&nbsp;The bullets narrowly missed her.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Fortunately, Warren survived the horrible nightmare, but he sure had to fight for his life.&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Drug Case Led to Attempted Murderer&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p style=text-align:justify>During the investigation, Warren was asked about any suspected individual who wanted him dead. He then mentioned his ex-wife, Claudia Haro,&nbsp;but the police could not arrest her straight away as she was nowhere around the picture as a suspect in the attempted murder. She also conveniently provided the alibi of the night of the attempted murder.</p><p style=text-align:justify>After cross-questions, police looked for potential criminals, but to no avail; the case remained unsolved for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Celeb In Legal Trouble:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>YNW Melly [Rapper] Charged, Friends, Age, Killing</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Two years after the attempted attack on Garrett in 2002, police unintentionally solved&nbsp;the case. This was possible when they busted a random drug case finding an envelope containing&nbsp;directions to Garrett's house, where he was shot, and his picture.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>The Man Behind the Attempt</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Further investigation led the police to Haro;&nbsp;It was discovered that she had hired a hitman twice to attack and&nbsp;kill her ex-husband. The man was identified as Jorge Hernandez. Likewise, behind the mastermind were Haro herself and her brother Manuel Haro.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Claudia's brother was the one who arranged the hitman, and after the first failed attempt, Haro wanted a second attack to be carried out, but it never happened as she got arrested in 2005.</p><p style=text-align:justify>With all the chaos happening around her, Haro's ex-husband was there to support her throughout all this. He hired a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">private</a> investigator who advocated on all her charges. This raised questions about Joe Pesci being a part of the attempted murder case. However, he was free from any suspicion.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>During the court hearing, she pled no contest to attempting to murder her ex-husband, Garrett&nbsp;Warren. Claudia was sentenced to 12 years in jail. She completed her sentence and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">got out </a>in&nbsp;August 2019.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Married Life with Ex-Husband&nbsp;</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Claudia was married to her former husband Garrett Warren- a Hollywood stunt man- from 25th March 1998 to 2000. Garrett is a high-profile Hollywood stuntman.</p><p style=text-align:justify>His resume includes movies, namely&nbsp;X-Men: Apocalypse (2016), Logan (2017), and Alita: Battle Angel (2019). He has over 110 stunts credits. He won the Streamy Awards in the Best Choreography category for the movie&nbsp;Mortal Kombat (2011).&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>The couple also had a daughter around December of the same year of their marriage.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Claudia Haro with Ex-husband Garrett Warren & their daughter</strong> <strong>(source:&nbsp;marriedbiography.com)</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>Unfortunately, Warren's tight work schedule brought difficulties in their relationship. In 1999 the couple filed for divorce and began the custody battle&nbsp;of their daughter. A year later,&nbsp;Warren was granted the shared custody of their daughter, which was not pleasing for Haro, according to him.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Talking about failed marriages, Claudia was married to her former husband Joe Pesci from 7th September 1988 to 1992 before she tied the knot with Garrett.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Haro also shares a daughter named Tiffany Pesci with her ex-spouse Joe.&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Who Is Joe Pesci?&nbsp;</h2><p style=text-align:justify><a href=# rel=follow>Joe Pesci</a> is an Oscar-winning Hollywood actor; he won the Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Goodfellas (1990). His filmography includes movies like Lethal Weapon 4&nbsp;(1998), 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag (1997), and A Bronx Tale&nbsp;(1993).&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>As it turns out, Pesci and his ex-wife Haro also starred in movies like&nbsp;Gone Fishin' (1997) and Casino (1994) together.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>In 1999, he announced his retirement from acting. He also appeared in minor parts in the movies: Good Shepherd&nbsp;(2006) and Love Ranch (2010).&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-605 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Finally, in 2019, he returned to acting with a full-fledged role in The Irishman. He was nominated for the Oscar's Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role category.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>As of 2022, Haro is now out of jail, and not much of her personal life or professional life has come into the limelight.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Stay with us for <a href=# rel=follow>more updates</a>!!&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-625 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpykkaqxqq2MoZirp12stqy1jJqpq52jqXqrrcilZaGsnaE%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fclaudia-haro-wiki-arrest-jail-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fclaudia-haro-wiki-arrest-jail-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fclaudia-haro-wiki-arrest-jail-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fclaudia-haro-wiki-arrest-jail-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fclaudia-haro-wiki-arrest-jail-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fclaudia-haro-wiki-arrest-jail-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./friendly-house-davenport-hosts-hogtoberfest-fundraiser.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./friendly-house-davenport-hosts-hogtoberfest-fundraiser.html>Friendly House, Davenport, hosts Hogtoberfest fundraiser</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./100-reasons-to-love-america-in-2022.html>100 Reasons to Love America in 2022</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./100-reasons-to-love-america-in-2022.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
