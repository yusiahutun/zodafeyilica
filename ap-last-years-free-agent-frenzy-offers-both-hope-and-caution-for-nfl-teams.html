Tampa Bay took on more than $80 million in dead money and went cheap at QB, signing Mayfield to a one-year, $4 million deal. Mayfield delivered with a career-high 28 TD passes to lead the Bucs to a division title and a playoff win. He earned about $2.85 million in incentives but was still a bargain.</p><p>DE Jadeveon Clowney, Baltimore: The Ravens became the latest team to give Clowney a one-year prove-it deal when they signed the 2014 No. 1 overall pick in August. Clowney earned just over $4 million for his one season with incentives after matching his career high with 9 1/2 sacks for the NFL’s stingiest defense.</p><p>LB Drue Tranquill, Kansas City: The Chiefs added depth at linebacker when they made a low-profile move of signing Tranquill to a one-year, $3 million deal. He was a key part of a defense that helped carry Kansas City to a Super Bowl title with 4 1/2 sacks and 78 tackles in the regular season and 21 more tackles during the playoff run.</p><p>TE Dalton Schultz, Houston: The Texans were looking for a veteran pass catcher to help rookie QB C.J. Stroud and found one in Schultz. Houston signed him to a one-year, $6.25 million deal and got 59 catches for 635 yards and five TDs in the regular season and another TD in the playoffs from Schultz.</p><p>G Isaac Seumalo, Pittsburgh: The Steelers went into last offseason looking to bolster the offensive line and did a good job with the addition of Seumalo, who signed a three-year, $24 million deal. Seumalo allowed no sacks in the season and was the 10th-rated guard in the NFL, according to Pro Football Focus.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>FREE AGENT BUSTS</h3><p>QB Jimmy Garoppolo, Las Vegas: The Raiders needed a replacement after moving on from Derek Carr and hoped that Garoppolo would be a good fit with his former OC Josh McDaniels as head coach in Las Vegas. But Garoppolo missed much of the offseason recovering from foot surgery after signing a three-year, $72.75 million contract. He struggled once he got on the field, throwing nine INTs in six starts before being benched. His suspension for performance-enhancing drugs will get the Raiders out of $11.25 million in guarantees this season</p><p>QB Derek Carr, New Orleans: The Saints’ deal for Carr didn’t work out a whole let better for New Orleans. Carr signed a $150 million, four-year deal with the hopes of leading the Saints to the playoffs in the NFL’s weakest division. New Orleans couldn’t take advantage as Carr got off to a shaky start to the season and narrowly missed the playoffs.</p><p>RT Mike McGlinchey, Denver: The Broncos gave the second-biggest deal in free agency when they signed him to a five-year, $87.5 million deal. But the same issues that led to San Francisco moving on from its 2018 first-round pick were still evident in Denver. McGlinchey struggled at times in pass protection with his 49 pressures allowed ranking sixth most among all tackles last season, according to PFF.</p><p>WR Allen Lazard, New York Jets: The Jets brought in one of Aaron Rodgers’ receivers from Green Bay in hopes that the familiarity would lead to success in New York. But Rodgers lasted only one series and Lazard never lived up to the four-year, $44 million deal he signed. Lazard had just 23 catches for 311 yards and one TD with just four catches in the final nine games of the season.</p><p>WR JuJu Smith-Schuster, New England: The Patriots let Jakobi Meyers leave for Las Vegas in free agency and signed Smith-Schuster to a slightly cheaper deal instead. While Meyers had his third straight season with at least 800 yards, Smith-Schuster had just 29 catches for 260 yards and one TD after signing a three-year, $27 million deal.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfqL2wvtOsZpqoXaGutMCMspyaqqNis7OxxGaYoJ2eqXqnvsSnsbJln5uzpr7SZpmorJhitbC8xGaYp5xdmK62wMiopWaen6d6r7LLZquemZ2ofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fap-last-years-free-agent-frenzy-offers-both-hope-and-caution-for-nfl-teams.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fap-last-years-free-agent-frenzy-offers-both-hope-and-caution-for-nfl-teams.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fap-last-years-free-agent-frenzy-offers-both-hope-and-caution-for-nfl-teams.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fap-last-years-free-agent-frenzy-offers-both-hope-and-caution-for-nfl-teams.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fap-last-years-free-agent-frenzy-offers-both-hope-and-caution-for-nfl-teams.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fap-last-years-free-agent-frenzy-offers-both-hope-and-caution-for-nfl-teams.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mejores-protectores-solares-stick-solido-barra.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mejores-protectores-solares-stick-solido-barra.html>Los mejores protectores solares en 'stick' para uso diario</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./highlights-erie-prophetstown-35-orion-34.html>Highlights: Erie-Prophetstown 35, Orion 34</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./highlights-erie-prophetstown-35-orion-34.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
