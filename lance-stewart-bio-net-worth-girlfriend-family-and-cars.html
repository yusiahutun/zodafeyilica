He is known on Vine and Youtube for his funny videos. On these two platforms, he is one of the most followed prominent entertainers there. This huge following has certainly made him rich, an inspiration for others, and someone worth writing and discussing. All this is thanks to his sister Sabrina, who taught him how to make videos about the vine. Since then there has been no looking back.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Lance Stewart Bio and Family&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Lance was born as the son of Bruce and Nina Stewart on June 20, 1996, in Philadephia, Pennsylvania, USA. He grew up in Frankville, New Jersey, with his family, including his older sister Sabrina Stewart, to whom he is very close. There is not much detailed information about his childhood life as he has not yet revealed any or has reasons to share it with the public.</p><p>However, we do know that he was educated at Delsea Regional High School when he was enrolled there from 2010 to 2014. During his time here, he discovered early enough that schooling did not take him where he wanted to be in life, or maybe he simply had no feeling for the classroom. So he spent more time creatively thinking about what we go on YouTube today to watch him do it.</p><p>Lance Stewart learned how to make videos from his sister Sabrina. She never really made videos about vines herself, but she often watched many that she found very funny and shared them with her brother. Lance saw this as an opportunity and learned more about the vine from his sister. Today he is very grateful to his sister for this special case in which she introduced him to the vine.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Tommy Chong Dead, Net Worth, Parents, Wife, Kids, Wiki</a></strong></p><p>Lance soon created his vine account and started making short comedy videos of himself as a hobby. What began as a hobby led to him collecting thousands and millions of views of every video he posted on the platform. His Vine Channel gathered more than 5.7 million followers.</p><p>His first video was “It’s My Money and I Need It Now”, which at the time generated over 900,000 likes and 800,000 revines. Many other popular and humorous videos followed on the platform before Vine was closed when he moved his interest platform from Vine to YouTube.</p><p>On YouTube, fame and popularity marked his entry into the platform as he gained more than 30,000 subscribers in the first 4 months of joining the popular site. He currently has nearly 4 million subscribers with over 700 videos on the channel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>Lance is in a relationship with his beautiful and sexy girlfriend, Elizabeth Wurst, who is also a YouTube star and is often referred to as Lizzy Wurst. Both met when they were at Delsea Regional High School. This happened on a particular day when they both walked down the hall in opposite directions. Lizzy thought he was cute and wanted to know more about him. She snuck around the Kik-Bote app and came across his profile. She sent him a message: “Hey, you’re really cute.”</p><p>Lance replied, and so their love story began in May 2013. Lance took things up and set the pace because he didn’t want to see this beauty go by. He visited her many times, and one particular day he went there with a dozen roses and asked her to be his girlfriend. She then set an accent, and today we have the two talented YouTubers together.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Alicia Machado Bio, Net Worth, Weight, Body Measurements, Family, Facts</a></strong></p><p>She was born on July 22, 1998, which makes her 2 years younger than her boyfriend. She has published comic videos on Vine, just like her boyfriend did when the platform was still famous. Lizzy launched her YouTube channel in mid-2016 and currently has more than 1 million loyal subscribers. Her videos on YouTube range from challenge videos to make-up and other things that are especially interesting for the female sex. She has also made some videos in collaboration with her boyfriend Lance Stewart.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Lance Stewart Net Worth and Cars</strong></h2><p>Lance Stewart has an estimated net worth of $2.5 million He lives in Philadelphia, where he drives a blue-chrome Audi R8 v10 For his father’s 50th birthday he gave him a brand new Corvette Z06, which was his dream car.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuaK6wp5krKyVrK6zwIyboKhlnprBbsPOq6uhZZeev62y0aKcp5xdm66utcuyZJqmlGKwor7SaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flance-stewart-bio-net-worth-girlfriend-family-and-cars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flance-stewart-bio-net-worth-girlfriend-family-and-cars.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flance-stewart-bio-net-worth-girlfriend-family-and-cars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flance-stewart-bio-net-worth-girlfriend-family-and-cars.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flance-stewart-bio-net-worth-girlfriend-family-and-cars.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flance-stewart-bio-net-worth-girlfriend-family-and-cars.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./richard-schiff-says-he-found-purpose-in-acting-exclusive.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./richard-schiff-says-he-found-purpose-in-acting-exclusive.html>Richard Schiff Candidly Reveals Acting Saved His Life: I Found a Purpose (Exclusive)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jack-nunge.html>Jack Nunge Bio, Age, Parents, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jack-nunge.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
