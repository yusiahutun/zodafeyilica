Whether you like your curls tight and coily, loose and wavy, uniform and polished, or textured and messy, using a curling iron makes it easy to create a vast array of looks with one simple tool.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve never had a curling iron in your hair arsenal —&nbsp;or worse, have had one in your lineup but have been left unsatisfied —&nbsp;there is a lot to consider before investing, especially for these notoriously tricky tools. You’ll need to consider your natural hair type, the health of your hair, and (of course) the look you’re trying to achieve. Not to mention, the perfect curling iron needs to be a snap to use (no one has time for an extended learning curve). With so many different curling irons on the market, combing through all your options is no easy task —&nbsp; so we did it for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our team of InStyle editors rigorously tested the 14 buzziest and most popular curling irons out there. We used the tool across every hair type in our New York City-based Lab, as well as in our own natural hair for two weeks. For each curling iron, we measured the speed at which the iron came to our desired temperature, the ease of using it, the durability of the curl (using benchmarks of one hour, six hours, and overnight), clamp tension, range of heat settings, and then assessed our hair for any damage during and after use. We also considered the way our hair looked overall after each styling session. After compiling and evaluating all the testing data, we ranked each curling iron, and the highest scoring tools are featured on this list.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-hot-tools-pro-artist-black-gold-digital-curling-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hot Tools Pro Artist Digital Curling Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hot Tools Black Gold Digital Salon Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UBPClgK6LPagR5SEiC-JTEmshdo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Hot-Tools-Black-Gold-Digital-Salon-Curling-Iron-6740d49a14df410b9c60cecdafd7d9a8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hot Tools</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This tool performs flawlessly across all hair types.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Those with finer hair may find that their hair slips out of the iron during use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s rare to find a curling iron that delivers a solid curl across all hair textures regardless of the size of the barrel, but this one from Hot Tools did just that. We tried three different sized barrels — 0.75-inch, 1.25-inch, and 1.5-inch —&nbsp; and we found that each one delivered on their styling promises (beachy waves for larger sizes, tighter curls for smaller). Not only did our curls look great immediately after styling, but they also held their shape for the rest of the day, and even sometimes the next morning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Design-wise, we were impressed with all the helpful features: It heated up in just a few seconds and conveniently beeped when it was ready. The clamp was comfortable and never caught or tugged at our hair, and the digital temperature screen made it easy to view and adjust the heat as needed. The extra long cord was another unexpected, but appreciated detail. Clocking in at nine feet, it was very easy to maneuver the tool around our heads, even when the outlet was a distance away from our mirror and our vanity was cluttered with beauty products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most hot tools will break when used with a power converter abroad, but because this tool offers dual voltage, we were able to safely style our hair while traveling outside of the country.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though this curling iron worked beautifully across all hair types, the clamp wasn’t quite tight enough to fully secure our fine strands and the baby hairs sometimes slipped out. With a few spritzes of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dry shampoo</a> or texturizing spray that have some hold and grip, we were easily able to touch up our curls.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>Available in 0.75-inch, 1-inch, 1.25-inch, 1.5-inch | <strong>Barrel Material: </strong>Proprietary black gold styling surface | <strong>Automatic Shut Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-conair-infinitipro-tourmaline-ceramic-curling-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon InfinitiPRO by Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FrtS_jOrHvYlwUB6z8Ms4UnU8KI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Conair-InfinitiPRO-Tourmaline-Ceramic-Curling-Iron-47d3b7668260475c984ddd3de8eeb953.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Beyond the price, we loved how smooth it made our hair and the even, consistent curl pattern it created.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The clamp is removable, which sometimes made it harder to use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve ever experienced the phenomenon of never achieving the same result twice with a curling iron, this tool should be on your radar —&nbsp;especially at such a wallet-friendly price. The Infinitipro consistently spat out shiny, glossy curls that lasted through the day and beyond, especially on thicker and more textured hair. In fact, we found that our curls lasted up to four days on our very curly hair — no touch-ups required.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With the unique removable clamp, this iron is actually a two-in-one: It can be used as a traditional curling iron or as a wand to achieve a wide range of styles. While we enjoyed the duality, if the clamp wasn’t correctly attached it fell off mid-use and snagged our hair. When we took the time to secure it, it was smooth curling.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finding a two-in-on hot tool under $30 is a rare gem, and despite the clamp mishaps, we still love the way our hair looked (and a good deal, too).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>0.75-inch, 1-inch, 1.25-inch, 1.5-inch | <strong>Barrel Material: </strong>Tourmaline, ceramic&nbsp; | <strong>Automatic Shut Off: </strong>Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-dyson-airwrap-multi-styler-complete-long></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dyson Airwrap</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler Complete Long" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/f67CWzuqtj1VgKG0MSvveHfIJ0c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/airwrap-multistyler-complete-long-dyson-2bc69a951bec42a992d8e7b3a4d3fee2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This styling system is basically an entire salon’s worth of hot tools in one device.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Because this tool harnesses air to curl hair, it sometimes sucks up pieces of already-styled strands when trying to work on a new section.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re skeptical about spending so much money on a hot tool, believe us when we say that the Dyson Airwrap is worth the investment (and the hype). With just one purchase, you’ll get the tool itself, six attachments, and a sleek leather storage box to keep it all in, meaning you can cut down your collection of heat stylers to just this (amazing) one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike many other options, Dyson taps air instead of a heated surface to curl the hair, and to our delight, we experienced zero heat damage, even when we used it several times a week on bonded hair extensions. With the Airwrap, we didn’t have to get super close to our scalp and risk the integrity of the bonds in order to get our extensions to support a curl. It’s also worth noting that we used the second generation Airwrap that comes with barrels that allow you to switch the direction of the airflow. Although it's a small detail, it had a big payoff because it made it super easy for us to ensure our curls were all facing the right direction. Our curls held well, though on finer hair, the larger barrel resulted in more of a bouncy blowout effect than a true curl.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The strong suction powers on this device created solid curls, but that also meant it often sucked in pieces we had already styled. We recommend pinning up finished sections —&nbsp;not only will this help keep them out of the way, it’ll also help the curl set and last longer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1.2-inch, 1.6-inch |<strong> Barrel Material: </strong>Alloy | <strong>Automatic Shut Off: </strong>No<strong><br></strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-damaged-hair-shark-flexstyle-air-styling-and-drying-system></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Damaged Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shark FlexStyle Air Styling and Drying System</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shark FlexStyle Air Styling and Drying System" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jbofyDInjSBn2vDgNkzNe1Y9BT0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shark-flexstyle-air-styling-and-drying-system-880d1fc7d12440dd913f1252e8fcffc2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This device from Shark offers similar technology to the Dyson, along with unique attachment options to choose from, at half the price.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>There are barrels for both left- and right-facing curls, so you’ll have to switch them out as you work.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re not ready to splurge on the Airwrap but want a hot air-based curling iron that will care for your damaged hair, the Shark is your best — and most customizable — option. In this choose your own adventure, hairstyling edition, you’re free to select three attachments (out of eight total options), which include two curling barrel sizes, a variety of brushes, concentrator, comb, and even a diffuser.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although the Shark looked intimidating, we got the hang of it quickly and were styling our hair like pros within minutes. While the tool does heat up, it never reached a temperature that scorched our hair or scalp, instead producing a lasting curl that required few, if any, touch-ups. We were never able to master a tight ringlet; we’d compare our final look as model off-duty beach waves, which is perfectly fine by us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite how easy the Shark was to operate, it was a bit annoying having to switch out barrels to change the direction of our curl. That said, this only takes a few seconds, and&nbsp; Shark clearly distinguishes between the two — there is a very clear “L” and “R” on the corresponding attachments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>0.59-inch, 1.25-inch | <strong>Barrel Material: </strong>Not applicable, uses air</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-ghd-classic-curl-1-inch-curling-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Beginners</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ghd 1-Inch Curling Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ghd Classic Curl 1-Inch Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oajDcsQ4hsPfqr6UX8cCMXuYAmQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GHD-Curve-Classic-Curl-1-Inch-Iron-3fceb18f0b384071a5e248b7968bcae7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This is the lightest curling iron we’ve ever held, making it very comfortable to use during long styling sessions.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>There is only one heat setting, which may not work for all hair types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re new to using a curling iron, you might find yourself getting tired while styling — they’re often so heavy that you end up getting a vigorous arm workout along with a head full of curls. Even though this tool is a premium and well-made device, it feels incredibly light (the lightest we’ve ever tried), making it a breeze to hold (an especially important quality for neophytes) as it works to give hair a lasting curl with minimal frizz.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Interestingly, the iron only has one heat setting (365 degrees); it’s considered a safe temperature for most hair types, so it didn’t really bother us. However, when we tested the iron on very fine hair, the heat zapped too much moisture from our strands and left our hair steaming after just a few seconds. We didn’t encounter any issues with thicker hair, though. In fact, when used on type 2 and 4 textures, our curls maintained their shape for days.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Temperature aside, we liked the clamp’s nice, strong grip that didn’t yank at our hair, but kept it firmly in place as we styled, while the barrel was smooth enough to slide our finished curls right off.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a bonus, if you travel frequently, you’ll enjoy the universal voltage (no frying your hot tool on vacation!) and the automatic sleep mode, which kicks in after 30 minutes (it’s easy to forget to turn off a curling iron, especially when jet-lagged).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1-inch | <strong>Barrel Material: </strong>Ceramic | <strong>Automatic Shut Off: </strong>Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beach-waves-instyler-cerasilk-1-inch-curling-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Beach Waves</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>InStyler Cerasilk Curling Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="InStyler Cerasilk 1-Inch Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IxAeK3hS7wCyEtSBcYmt4hmCWOI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/InStyler-Cerasilk-1-Curling-Iron-d5c3a10112374d8ca1893a914a149fe0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyler</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The ultra-long barrel is perfect for creating loose, mermaid-like waves.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>This doesn’t have a clamp, which is terrific for making waves, but requires a bit of a learning curve.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When creating beach waves, we find it’s easiest to achieve that look when using a long-barreled curling wand without a clamp, and this tool from InStyler fits the bill. Thanks to the clamp-free design, we were able to loosely wrap our hair along the barrel, creating elongated curls that even a mermaid would envy. That said, the tip of this styling tool features a unique “feeder” grip tip that allows for easy one-handed styling, so if you prefer a clamp, you do have options.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The barrel of this curling wand features a special coating that allows heat to pass through without allowing hair to directly touch the heat source, ultimately cutting way down on potential damage. Even our fine hair, which never held a curl for more than two minutes, met its match with this curling wand — our waves lasted much longer than they did with any other hot tool.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For many people, using a curling wand is far easier than a traditional curling iron because of the way you can customize your curl. On the flip side, it’ll take some trial and error to master your technique. If you’re winding your hair too tightly around the barrel of the InStyler, you’ll get tight ringlets, though they will relax and get beachier, especially if you brush them out.

We also loved the huge variety of heat settings, so we didn’t have to settle for too-hot temps, which diffused evenly down the barrel (no fried ends!).

We curled our almost waist-length strands in one go, never needing to go over the same section twice. We just kept wrapping our hair around the barrel until we reached the end. We bet even those with shorter hair will find the barrel length helpful to grab the hard-to-reach pieces in the back. One small but mighty detail we loved was the generously-sized cool tip at the end of the barrel, so we could control the iron without burning our fingers. We were able to craft loose, beachy waves without much effort —&nbsp;we didn’t even need to brush our hair once we were finished because this iron produced such natural-looking waves.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the most part, our finished look maintained shape throughout the day. Although when we tested it on thick hair, we found that our style didn’t last as long and required frequent touch-ups. With that in mind, it may not be the best pick for thick or heavy hair, but it was brilliant with fine to medium strands.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1-inch, 1.25-inch, 1.5-inch | <strong>Barrel Material: </strong>Ceramic | <strong>Automatic Shut Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-short-hair-babylisspro-nano-titanium-spring-curling-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Short Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium Curling Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium Spring Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/efScv8NVjjodVjgxbU7RSFYnpl0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/babylisspro-nano-titanium-spring-curling-iron-a1f08f01f4fa45299102b450324d7582.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This tool’s clamp never left hard lines or crimps in our curls.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The temperature gauge isn't very straightforward.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When looking for a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curling iron for short hair</a>, it's important to get it right, since you have limited real estate to get the perfect ringlet — and irons with long barrels aren’t the easiest to maneuver. But because this BaByliss tool has a short wand and a gentle, yet effective clamp, it was super simple for us to form smooth, glorious curls, leaving our shoulder-length hair free of any harsh bends or creases that we sometimes get from other irons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We had the option to choose between four barrel sizes, and we tested the 0.75-inch. At first, we were annoyed by how long it was taking us to curl our hair (after all, smaller barrels meant we had to use smaller sections of hair). Despite our grumbling, that extra time was worth the effort: Firm, stunning curls with kangaroo-levels of bounce. With a quick finger comb and light brushing, along with a spritz of hairspray, the style slayed all day and night. We even rocked the wavy remnants the next day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only downside of this tool is the temperature gauge — there are almost too many options to choose from and we’re still not exactly sure what some of the settings do (we’re talking to you, Boost mode).

We had almost given up, accepting that our hair would always just slide out of the clamp looking like a wet noodle. That all changed when we tested this hero tool. Though it’s pretty budget friendly, it comes with pricier features, including three detachable barrels in different sizes, an LED temperature screen, and accessories, like a protective glove, hair clips, and storage bag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we’ve used a lot of curling irons that snagged our fine strands in the past, the smooth barrels and an unfussy clamp (with a comfortable grip) on this one allowed our curls to gently roll off when we were done. Our finished look actually lasted four days with this tool — a downright miracle for our hair. We attribute the longevity in part to the helpful temperature guide, which taught us that we’ve been curling our hair with too much heat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If we could change one thing about this nearly perfect curling iron, it would be the awkward button placement. There is just one button to power the iron on/off and to change the temperature (pressing and holding for a few seconds turns it on/off and simply hitting it, even softly, adjusts the temperature) and it’s unwisely situated right where you hold the handle. A mild annoyance is a small sacrifice for the fabulous curls it gave us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>0.5-inch, 1-inch, 1.5-inch | <strong>Barrel Material: </strong>Ceramic | <strong>Automatic Shut Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To ensure we thoroughly analyzed the performance of each device, we tested each curling iron across many metrics. We started in our NYC-based Lab and used each iron to curl hair types 1–4, and evaluated the curls’ longevity by checking in at the one-hour mark, six-hour mark, and then overnight to see how well each held the curl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once this portion of the test was complete, we sent each curling iron to three editors, each with a different hair type and texture, to incorporate into their hair styling routine over a two-week period. During this portion, we evaluated each iron for ease of use, the shape and endurance of the curls, the heat damage it caused (if any), and the overall quality of the final look. At the end of the two-week test, we compiled and digested the data from each editor, and then ranked each iron accordingly. Our very favorite curling irons earned the highest marks, and are featured on this list.</p><span id=mntl-sc-block-inlinevideo__title_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-inlinevideo__title mntl-text-block">The InStyle Team Tests Curling Irons</span> <span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What To Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hair Type<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When selecting a curling iron, you’ll want to consider the qualities of your hair itself —&nbsp;not just the length, which may benefit from an extra-long curling rod like those found from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">InStyler Cerasilk Curling Iron</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Bio Ionic Long Barrel Curling Iron</a>.

For these hair types, New York City-based hairstylist Vennela Chamarti uses medium to high heat settings (around 375 degrees or above). This goes for super healthy hair, too. “Often, very silky and healthy hair doesn’t hold a curl as well, and therefore needs more heat,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">ARKIVE Headcare</a> founder, Adam Reed, prefers using one flat temperature for all hair, regardless of its texture or type —&nbsp;365 degrees, which he says is the best universal styling temperature. “365 degrees is the most respectful temperature to any hair type,” he says. “It’ll warm any hair type enough to mold it into the curl you want — if you go above that you risk higher damage, and if you go below that the curls will fall.” Conveniently, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">ghd Classic Curl 1-Inch Curling Iron</a> is set at this precise temperature.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, if your hair stubbornly refuses to hold a curl at all, we hate to admit it, but it’s likely due to user error. DiGregorio recommends taking smaller sections and using a slightly smaller barrel size, like the 0.75-inch version of <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Conair InfinitiPRO Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron</a>. “Be mindful that each hair section can easily wrap around the iron with a little room to spare,” she says. “This enables the heat to reach every hair in the section.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Charmarti also says to let your hair cool down completely after styling.

The larger the barrel, the looser your curl will be, so if you want a faux blowout effect or a beachy wave, look for a thick barrel.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">DiGregorio recommends keeping your hair length under consideration, too. She uses 1-inch barrels for above-the-shoulder-length hair, 1.25-inch to 1.5-inch barrels for medium length hair, and 2-inch barrels on hair that’s lower than a bra hook. As mentioned, if your hair doesn’t hold a curl well, go with a smaller-sized barrel.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ultimately, your hair type plays no role in what barrel size you should pick, just in how you style: “If you have thicker hair, use smaller sections on your hair; if you have thinner hair, you can use larger sections,” explains Reed.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Barrel Material<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ll really only see three kinds of materials when it comes to curling iron barrels: Ceramic, tourmaline, and titanium. If you have coarse hair that is heat resistant, titanium is the way to go. “It’s a natural metal that heats up very fast and will help the heat penetrate fully through the hair,” says DiGregorio, who adds that it’s also a lightweight material to hold. You’ll find it in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium Spring Curling Iron</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ceramic and tourmaline tools are a bit gentler on the hair as they don’t get quite as hot. DiGregorio likes ceramic, as she finds they create the most even heat throughout the iron. If you have an issue with the smoothness of your hair, check out a tourmaline tool. “Tourmaline is a crystal mineral that emits negative ions to counteract positive ions, which helps keep moisture and shine,” says DiGregorio.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What's the best way to use a curling iron?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best way to use a curling iron is whatever way it feels most comfortable for you. Some people may prefer a wand, while others may prefer a traditional curling iron with a clamp. “Being able to curl your hair in a way that’s comfortable and doesn’t strain your arms will yield better results and less damage,” says Chamarti (that includes avoiding burning yourself!).<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes down to specific looks, you can create a tighter curl by using your iron just off the scalp. Meanwhile, you’ll achieve a looser style if you skip the root and start wrapping your hair about a third of the way down the shaft. “Holding the curl horizontally will make the curl fuller, vertically will provide a more relaxed look,” adds DiGregorio. If you’re going for a beach wave or modern vibe, Reed loves to curl hair in different directions to prevent uniformity or an overdone look. “If you’re looking for classic curls, keep the iron going in one direction,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The most important thing to do when styling your hair with a curling iron is to keep things moving to avoid heat damage. “Do not leave the iron on your hair for too long,” warns Reed. “If I’m doing a wave or a curl, I’m always moving the tool underneath the hair to evenly distribute the heat and make sure one section isn’t being overheated.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What's the difference between a curling iron and a curling wand?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only true difference between curling irons and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curling wands</a> is that an iron has a clamp to hold your hair in place while you style. You’ll also find that wands come in more shapes than curling irons do, such as conical and bubble, says DiGregorio. The one-two punch of a unique shape, plus a lack of clamp makes it simpler to achieve beachy waves or undone look —&nbsp;putting less tension on the hair with your fingers will make for a looser curl.
