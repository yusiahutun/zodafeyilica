The Queen of Easter Eggs herself <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/target-taylor-swift/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift unveiled puzzles</a> in anticipation of her newest Taylor’s Version album.</p><p>It was the biggest announcement during one of the biggest tours in history.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</a>&nbsp;was announced during Taylor’s last date for her US leg of the Eras Tour. “The last time that I was so pleasantly surprised by some stuff that you guys did was when I announced that I was going to be re-recording. That was something that I expected to be just a me thing, just a personal thing. Since I was a teenager, I wanted to own my&nbsp;<a href=#>music</a>,” she said onstage. “The way to do it was to re-record my albums, and the way that you have embraced … that you have celebrated, that you really decided that it was your fight too, and that you were 100 percent behind me … I will never stop thanking you for that.”</p><p>She continued, “And so now, here we are on the last night of the U.S. leg of the Eras tour in the eighth month of the year on the ninth day. You might have noticed there are some new outfits in the show. There’s something that I’ve been planning for a really, really, really ridiculously, embarrassingly long time, and instead of telling you about it, I think I’ll just sort of show you.” Swift then unveiled the cover art and release date for&nbsp;1989 (Taylor’s Version)—October 27, 2023, mark your calendars—before launching into “New Romantics,” a fan-favorite song from the deluxe version of the album</p><p>She posted on Instagram, “Surprise!! 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is on its way to you The 1989 album changed my life in countless ways, and it fills me with such excitement to announce that my version of it will be out October 27th. To be perfectly honest, this is my most FAVORITE re-record I’ve ever done because the 5 From The Vault tracks are so insane. I can’t believe they were ever left behind. But not for long!”</p><p>Swifties can take action and find out the titles for the From The Vault tracks after they collectively do these tasks.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.89252814739><h2>How To Do Taylor Swift Puzzle</h2><p>How can you take part in the Taylor Swift puzzle? According to<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://blog.google/products/search/taylor-swift-google-search-easter-egg/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Google’s Blog</a> all you have to do is type in the search bar “Taylor Swift” and when you hit enter, a blue vault will appear at the bottom of the screen. Once you click on the blue vault, a series of letters will appear and you will have to decode each puzzle. Each person can do 89 puzzles, aptly named for 1989. Once 33 million answers are collectively submitted through Google, 1989 (Taylor’s Version) Vault track titles will be released.</p><p>Swifties already cracked the code for some of the clues. The first clue that I got when I searched up Taylor Swift is “She Lost Him.” Other clues include an astrological sign Sagittarius making all signs point to a potential collab with Nicki Minaj. In other attempts to decode, other clues include &nbsp;“I Love You,” “All You Had to Do Was Stay,” “Karma Music Video,” “Likes, Job, Whereabouts Were Studied Intently.”&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.5><h2>What Are 1989 (Taylor's Version) From The Vault tracks?</h2><p>Less than 24 hours after the puzzle was announced, Swifties did all 33 million puzzles. Here are the titles of four out of five tracks:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;“Is It Over Now?”</li><li>“Now That We Don’t Talk”</li><li>“Say Don’t Go”</li><li>“Suburban Legends”</li></ul><p>The fifth track has yet to be revealed. Google also admitted that the power of Swifties couldn’t be handled by the search engine. “Swifties, the vault is jammed! But don’t worry, there are not blank spaces inside,” it tweeted Tuesday evening. “We’re in our fix-it era and will be out of the woods soon.” They later said,&nbsp;“Swifties, we made it out of the woods! Bridges, built. Codes, cracked. Vault, opened.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.90549273021><h2>Where to Get 1989 (Taylor's Version)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1989-taylor-swift.png><p>Where can you get 1989 (Taylor’s Version)?
