Then, perhaps more importantly given the audience she reached on a weekly basis, from 1968 to 1971 she was the first black actress to star in her own television series and to portray a character who wasn’t a stereotypical one.</p><footer><a href=../../diahann-carroll-tv-series-julia-remembered-by-the-late-actress.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../jennifer-aniston-2010-golden-globes-valentino-dress-replica-the-morning-show-8363457.html>Jennifer Aniston Just Wore a Replica of Her 2010 Golden Globes Valentino Gown on &amp;quot;The Morning Show&amp;quot;</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

The lure of lower prices is leading people to pay for poor quality, botched transplants which leave them scarred and bloody.
Grim photos released by the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ISHRS) have shown what happens when these hair transplants go wrong.&nbsp;

In the same way that adding a set of bangs to a bob, getting partial or full highlights can completely transform your entire look. The catch?
