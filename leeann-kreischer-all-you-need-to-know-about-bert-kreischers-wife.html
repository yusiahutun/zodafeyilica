<time>27 Jan 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>LeeAnn Kreischer’s internet following has grown exponentially in recent years. This is thanks partly to her podcast “Wife of the Party,” a nod to Bert’s reputation as a hardcore partier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Her husband has also grown more famous and thriving in the comedy industry as more and more people find themselves attracted to his intense performances on the stage. The talented comedian is well-known for his unique comedic style, which involves delivering his stand-up routines shirtless.</p><p>Their union proves how great things can be when two people complement each other’s quirks. Despite her marriage to the more explosive Bert, LeeAnn Kreischer has maintained her down-to-earth presence. Keep reading to learn more about her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/berrt.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=LeeAnn_Kreischer_Background></span>LeeAnn Kreischer Background<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bert’s beloved wife, LeAnn, was born and raised in a small town in Georgia where she was reportedly “related to everyone on the whole mile and a half road” where her house stood.</p><p>In 2020, Bert opened up about the early days of their relationship on an episode of comedian Theo Von’s podcast. He revealed that LeeAnn was raised in the small town of Bowden, Georgia.</p><p>The land her family lives on has been occupied since 1840, according to the sign on the church where she and Bert got married. LeeAnn once <a href=#>said</a>: “Both my grandparents went to school in that church.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Long_Has_Bert_Kreischer_Been_With_His_Wife></span>How Long Has Bert Kreischer Been With His Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bert and his wife, <a href=#>LeeAnn</a>, have been married for over 19 years. The pair married on December 28, 2003, in a low-key wedding ceremony held at a church in Bowden.</p><p>Years have passed since then, but the pair have remained loyal and in love with each other. Bert is known to celebrate their marital milestones on social media, ever ready to talk about how grateful he is to be married to LeeAnn.&nbsp;</p><p>The talented comedian, named Stand-Up Comedian of the Year by the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in 2023, has credited LeeAnn with most of his success.&nbsp;When he appeared as a guest on the “Are You Garbage?” podcast in March 2023, Bert praised LeeAnn Kreischer for helping him become such a huge success.&nbsp;</p><p>He said, “I could not have done this without her. I picked the right chick.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_LeeAnn_Kreischer></span>How Old Is LeeAnn Kreischer?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>LeeAnn was born in Bowden, Georgia, on August 19, 1971, under the zodiac sign Leo.

Her father, Jimmy Kemp, whom she often referred to as ‘Papa J,’ is an auto mechanic, while her mother used to work in a local factory where she sewed men’s suits.</p><p>After her parents’ divorce, LeeAnn and her mom <a href=#>moved</a> to Atlanta. Her mom became the “highest-paid model for about nine years.” Life with her mom was difficult because she suffered from narcissism and sociopathic tendencies.&nbsp;</p><p>LeeAnn does not blame her as a retired veteran with PTSD raised her mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=LeeAnn_Kreischers_Schooling></span>LeeAnn Kreischer’s Schooling&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She completed her schooling at Bowden High School, after which she attended West Georgia College for two years before getting transferred to Georgia State University.

They did not notice each other the first two times, but Bert caught her eye the third time, and she found him impressive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/berttt.jpg><p>Not long after, she took matters into her own hands by asking her friend to give Bert her phone number. When things did not pan out as she had hoped, LeeAnn summoned courage and approached the comedian herself. They started dating after that, and the relationship eventually led to a marriage that had been blessed with two kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1_owm_1PyGHNfnP4lE99n2mw.jpg><p>LeeAnn and Bert welcomed their two daughters, Georgia Kreischer and <a href=#>Ila Kreischer</a>, on June 8, 2004, and July 19, 2006.
