<time>05 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The end of the astrological season is near as Pisces season approaches. Here’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>how Pisces season 2024 will affect each zodiac sign</a> since the twelfth and final zodiacal season will be ultra-spiritual. Your intuition will heighten during Pisces season, so you may feel like you’re drifting between worlds.&nbsp;</p><p>Mysticism will set in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>when the sun enters Pisces</a> on February 18 at 11:13 p.m. ET. The solar luminary will answer to Pisces’ co-rulers, Jupiter and Neptune. Pisces season is undeniably optimistic yet nebulous thanks to these two planetary influences. You may feel more hopeful than usual during Pisces season, so anything could happen!</p><p>The lover planets will meet in an unusual embrace <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when Venus in Aquarius</a> kisses <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mars in Aquarius</a> on February 22. Usually, Venus and Mars scream red-hot passion and never-ending love when these two planets get together! But this “meet cute” will be different, so something unique and unconventional may pop up. Singles could have an awkward run-in turned romance while couples may realize that their relationship is truly one in a million.&nbsp;</p><p>By the following day, <a href=#>Mercury </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>will</a><a href=#> enter Pisces</a>. Seemingly simple conversations might come across as more nebulous and confusing. You may not get to the bottom of things as easily as expected. But Mercury in Pisces could help you find creative ways to convey your deepest thoughts and feelings. So, this could be an excellent Mercurial transit to write songs and poetry!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-23.png><p>A six-month cycle will conclude as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">full moon in Virgo</a> rises at 5 degrees on February 24. Since the Virgo-Pisces axis will be illuminated, there might be an emphasis on service. While it can be nice to pour yourself into others, the full moon will remind you that you matter too. After all, you can’t pour from an empty cup. Let the full moon wash away any inconsistencies in your life so that you can focus on your health and well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>A dreamy Pisces stellium will emerge on February 28 as the sun, Mercury, and Saturn come together. On one hand, this Pisces stellium could be inspiring if you need a boost of hope and creativity to get you through your day. On the other hand, this energy could also be overwhelming since it might be incredibly emotional and sensitive. If something gets to be too much, be like Pisces and swim away.&nbsp;</p><p>Love will be meant to be as Venus in Aquarius aspects <a href=#>the North Node</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>South Node</a> on February 29. Fate and destiny will align matters of the heart. No matter your relationship status, a unique yet serendipitous moment could help you believe in love once again.</p><p>Are you feeling lucky? The TikTok famous “lucky girl syndrome” will be undeniable when the sun in Pisces makes magic <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>with Jupiter in Taurus</a> on March 1. Everything could be too good to be true thanks to this incredible cosmic energy. Take advantage of it by manifesting your heart’s desires.</p><p>Unexpected twists in your commitments may pop up since Venus in Aquarius will create friction with Uranus in Taurus on March 3. You may feel more irritable than usual, especially if you’re stressed about your love life or fed up with people going back on their words. What may have been fine once upon a time won’t fly anymore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-24.png><p>Destined actions will be put in motion when Mars in Aquarius works with the North and South Nodes on March 4. If you want to set something in motion, then do it during this fateful cosmic energy. Taking a risk could pay off in incredible yet unforeseen ways. You’ll never know unless you try!&nbsp;</p><p>Pay attention to what your intuition is telling you as Mercury in Pisces joins Neptune in Pisces on March 8. You might be extra sensitive to the undertones in your interactions on and offline. Subtle tones, feelings, and more will be easier to catch. Don’t be surprised if you have incredible insight throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>The sun enters Pisces on February 18 at 11:13 p.m. ET and leaves it behind on March 19 at 11:06 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>Quick, insatiable conversations and curiosities will fire up after Mercury enters Aries on March 9. The cosmic messenger will feel extra spicy, so this could color your interactions with immense passion. Sparks will fly, so you can bounce off others when you’re talking about something that you’re excited about. If anything, be mindful about firing up too quickly since this energy could lead to more fights.&nbsp;</p><p>Set the intention to embrace your spiritual side during the <a href=#>new moon in Pisces</a> on March 10, which will occur at 20 degrees. A new six-month cycle will begin as it encourages you to be more reflective. During your introspective lunar cycle, your spirituality and light will become more pronounced if you learn to enjoy time by yourself. Moments of isolation might help you make sense of your inner and outer world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-16.png><p>Life will become so much sweeter when Venus exalts in Pisces on March 11. The love goddess will create auspicious moments for romance and abundance. With the help of Venus, you could manifest your dream relationship or financial opportunity. Serendipitous possibilities will be endless during this Venusian transit.&nbsp;</p><p>What will you pick up on? Your sensitivity to your external world and intuitive pings will heighten as the sun in Pisces joins Neptune in Pisces on March 17. It might be easier to read between the lines during this empathetic transit. As a result, you have a chance to connect more deeply with those around you and your own emotional processing.</p><p>Mark March 18 in your calendars! The cosmic energy will be major since the pre-shadow period for Mercury retrograde will begin while Mercury in Aries will also meet with the North and South Nodes. With Mercury as the star of the show, you can expect to have destined downloads and fateful conversations. Whatever comes up in a chat or to mind could become significant in the upcoming Mercury retrograde.</p><p>Your stamina and ambition will return once Pisces season commences when the sun becomes exalted in Aries on March 19 at 11:06 p.m. ET. The switch will be imminent, so you may be unable to sleep thanks to the fiery Aries energy!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-pisces-season-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign>How Pisces Season Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Are you ready for this mystical season to begin?

This might be a little out of the norm for you, but you may appreciate some alone time once the sun in Pisces enters your twelfth house of the subconscious and hidden. Pisces season is not the time to be proactive, so you might enter a hibernation-like mode. Luckily, some of your friends may pull you out of your cocoon when Venus in Aquarius joins Mars in Aquarius on February 22.&nbsp;</p><p>Two days later, the full moon in Virgo will encourage you to reflect on your health matters and goals. Are you in good physical, mental, and emotional shape? If not, think of this lunation as a chance to course-correct. Let go of any unsustainable habits that delay your progress.
