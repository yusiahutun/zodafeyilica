Opposition voters are largely made up of loyalists of the mainland-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) and the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) as well as those unhappy with the DPP government.Taiwanese Vice-President <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">William Lai Ching-te</span></a> is the presidential candidate of the independence-leaning DPP and has remained the front runner since he was nominated by the party in April to run for the island’s top post, according to various opinion polls.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/09/15/thumb-clean_0.jpg>Although the level of support for him has eased somewhat, Lai is still leading all other candidates, including New Taipei City mayor Hou Yu-ih of the KMT, Ko Wen-je, the head and candidate of the TPP, and Gou, who is <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">last in the field</span></a>, trailing at least 10 percentage points behind the others.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gou has not commented on the investigation, with his campaign team saying the billionaire is no longer involved in the company’s day-to-day business, though he remains a major shareholder.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zivon Wang, an analyst at the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies (CCAPS), a Taipei think tank, said the investigation was meant as a warning for Gou.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is also meant for all other mainland-based businesspeople, telling them not to stump for the pro-independence green camp while making money in China,” Wang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But it might have the opposite effect, with analysts suggesting voters could see the investigation as an attempt to interfere in the island’s elections, prompting them to turn to the DPP to show their displeasure with Beijing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Reports of the probe triggered a slump in Foxconn’s shares in the local stock market on Monday, and investors who suffered from huge losses would blame it on Beijing,” Wang Kung-yi, head of the Taiwan International Strategic Study Society, a Taipei think tank, said of the 3 per cent fall in Hon Hai shares.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/27/b2a3ac33-dc28-4157-9df8-9ad2f7a0cae7_a6b8c227.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Neutral voters or those who had yet to make up their minds on how they would vote might turn to the green camp, Wang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Definitely, the DPP would seize the opportunity to stir up anti-mainland sentiment, hoping voters unhappy with the mainland’s move would vote for its candidates,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taiwanese Premier Chen Chien-jen said on Monday the DPP government would serve as a “shield” for the island’s businesses. His deputy, Cheng Wen-tsan, called the Foxconn investigation “interference in Taiwan elections” and an attempt to “distort Taiwan’s democracy”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The following day, Lai hit out at Beijing over the investigation of the tech giant, saying Beijing should “cherish” Taiwanese companies given their contributions to the mainland’s economy and refrain from putting pressure on them during an election.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The DPP legislature caucus echoed Lai’s reproach, saying the mainland’s move would only fuel anti-Beijing sentiment on the island.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But CCAPS’ Wang said the DPP’s Beijing-bashing tactic might not be able to achieve the same result as it did in 2020 when Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen won her second term with the help of anti-Beijing sentiment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The probe is apparently targeting Gou, who has been known for his mainland-friendly stance. Since it is not against any Taiwan-centric business leaders, voters who identify themselves with Taiwan might not necessarily find the move unacceptable,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China says investigation into Apple supplier Foxconn is ‘normal law enforcement’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ho also said the atmosphere now was quite different from that surrounding Tsai’s re-election campaign.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The anti-government protests that rocked Hong Kong four years ago gave Tsai’s re-election campaign a strong boost as she told voters if they did not vote for her and the DPP, the island could end up as the next Hong Kong, heavily controlled by Beijing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“While the probe might upset Taiwanese people, if we have a closer look at the four candidates’ mainland policies, we can find that they are more or less the same – all supporting maintaining the cross-strait status quo which is a position in line with America’s expectation,” Ho said. He added that as this was what the US hoped to see, the green camp might not want to overly ratchet up the anti-Beijing mood on the island for election gains.</p>The US – an <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">informal ally</span></a> and the biggest arms supplier for Taiwan – has always claimed it has no desire to interfere in Taiwan’s elections but has sent <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">unofficial envoys</span></a> to the island to understand local conditions, especially near election time. Like most countries, the US does not recognise the island as an independent state but is opposed to any unilateral change of the cross-strait status quo by force.Meanwhile, Taiwan frequently accuses Beijing – which sees the island as its territory and does not renounce the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">use of force</span></a> to bring it back – of seeking to exert pressure, whether military or economic, to sway the outcome of its elections to ensure that the results are favourable to Beijing.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyxu8uiq6Kbo2Sus8DInKOeZ2NngHqAkm1mrZmZrK6vecSlnJysmaS7tHnHqK5mnp%2BtsLC6zWagp66VqMGqs8CtoKimXZi8trjDZpmam5ubtrOxjJucoqKZo7Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaiwan-elections-how-foxconn-investigation-could-backfire-beijing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaiwan-elections-how-foxconn-investigation-could-backfire-beijing.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaiwan-elections-how-foxconn-investigation-could-backfire-beijing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaiwan-elections-how-foxconn-investigation-could-backfire-beijing.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaiwan-elections-how-foxconn-investigation-could-backfire-beijing.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaiwan-elections-how-foxconn-investigation-could-backfire-beijing.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ecmascript-2023-es14-what-to-expect.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ecmascript-2023-es14-what-to-expect.html>What to Expect From ECMAScript 2023 (ES14)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rspca-knit-kittens-blankets.html>RSPCA is Looking For People To Knit Their Kittens Blankets</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rspca-knit-kittens-blankets.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
