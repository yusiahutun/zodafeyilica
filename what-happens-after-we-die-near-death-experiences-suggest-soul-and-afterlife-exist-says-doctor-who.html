Betty saw things that are, for a lack of a better word, inexplicable.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Betty didn’t die, but she did have a near-death experience (NDE) – according to Dr Jeffrey Long, a leading expert in these unusual events. The radiation oncologist, who oversees the care of cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy, lives and works in Kentucky, in the United States.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/12/76c0f20a-03b8-4bdc-94f6-f3393e1f73e9_81189d0d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Long has dedicated decades of his professional life to researching death – or those who have flirted with death and lived to tell the story. Betty’s is one of the more than 5,300 cryptic cases recorded on his Near-Death Experience Research Foundation website.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Long says NDEs “occur at a time when the person is so physically compromised that they are typically unconscious, comatose, or clinically dead”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">About 17 per cent of those who come close to death report NDEs. People of all ages, backgrounds and beliefs, from countries across the globe, have reported them, including on Long’s websites.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘He’s on one hell of a journey’: a father’s psychedelic trip as he died</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Each experience is unique to the individual, but the reports share common characteristics. Frequently, the person describes an overwhelming sense of ease, liberation from pain, and a general sense of euphoria. NDEs are almost never negative in nature.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Long first learned of the term “near-death experience” when he was in residency training decades ago, from an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“How can one not be fascinated about wondering what happens after we die?” he asks, recalling his reaction to the piece. It triggered his passion for researching NDEs and learning as much as he could from those who have had them.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Sceptics can’t explain anything that we observe in NDEs let alone the totality of what occurs during NDEsDr Jeffrey Long</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He set up the Near-Death Experience Research Foundation in 1998. Since then, through a form on its websites nderf.org, for Near Death Experience, adcrf.org, for After Death Communication, and oberf.org, for Out of Body Experience, Long has garnered more than 10,000 reports of “exceptional human experiences of all types”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“NDEs stand head and shoulders above all other categories of experiences in terms of their evidentiary reality and extensive content with evidence of a soul and an afterlife,” he says.</p>He has studied more than 5,000 NDEs and says about 45 per cent of people who have an NDE report an <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">out-of-body experience</span></a>, in which their consciousness is separated from their physical body. As “it” hovers above, the individual is able to see and hear what is happening around them.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/12/7e359a54-f77e-4482-9963-c09a230918ab_9c4d4951.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shortly after the out-of-body experience, people regularly find themselves transported into another realm. After travelling through a tunnel and experiencing a bright penetrating light, many, he says, report being greeted by deceased loved ones and sometimes pets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even if the loved one (or pet) died at an advanced age, they almost always appear to be in the prime of their lives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He adds that the majority of individuals expressed having a profound feeling of affection and tranquillity, and a reluctance to leave this alternate dimension.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/12/0ec0ad93-5fc1-4f1a-9d26-78863566cf1a_cb1f4dc7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some people have reported having had more than one of these extremely vivid, seemingly transformative experiences, Long says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">People reporting NDEs have no incentive to lie, Long says. To complete the questionnaire to file an NDE on the foundation’s website requires about 45 minutes. Those who do this are not paid, nor are their names ever made public.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Long goes to great lengths to add witness statements to support the NDE narratives offered.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Who is the ghostwriter of our mind?’: Werner Herzog tackles consciousness</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My goal is to uncover the truth about NDEs, wherever that path leads. I study NDEs as a scientist, not as a religious person,” he says, adding he was not particularly religious when he started his research – and that his goal is not to prove the existence of God.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Long rejects the idea that NDEs can be explained only by physical brain function, and says that more than 30 “sceptical” explanations of NDE have been presented over many decades.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“No one or several of these sceptical explanations make sense, even to the sceptics as a group,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He stressed that “sceptics can’t explain anything that we observe in NDEs let alone the totality of what occurs during NDEs”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A work in progress on his main website responds to specific sceptical arguments, including those that suggest the NDE is a reaction to hypoxia – reduced levels of oxygen in the brain and other bodily tissues – or to drugs, or that it is merely hallucination-induced.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He has also addressed the sceptics in published research and books. His papers include “Near-Death Experiences: Evidence for Their Reality”, published in the journal Missouri Medicine, in 2014.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Near-death experiences appear remarkably consistent around the world, and across many different religions and culturesDr Jeffrey Long</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He provides nine lines of evidence, based on his research and that of others, and concludes: “Multiple lines of evidence point to the conclusion that near-death experiences are medically inexplicable and cannot be explained by known physical brain function.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another paper, “The Phenomenology of Iranian Near-Death Experiences”, was published in The Journal of Near-Death Studies, in 2020. It provides an analysis of 17 near-death experience accounts provided by Iranian Shia Muslims to determine how theirs compare with NDE accounts by people from Western cultures.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His books include Evidence of the Afterlife: The Science of Near-Death Experiences (2011) and God and the Afterlife: The Groundbreaking New Evidence for God and Near-Death Experience (2015).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/12/40ebfe02-bd54-4aab-9eb2-fa91bae76da7_fdf59c91.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He joins many other researchers, including fellow medical doctors, in his keen interest in NDEs. He also contributed to a 2009 book, The Handbook of Near-Death Experiences: Thirty Years of Investigation, by psychiatrist Dr Bruce Greyson – another leading expert in NDEs, and former professor and counsellor Janice Miner Holden, who is president of the International Association for Near-Death Studies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although Long never set out to prove the existence of an afterlife or any sort of transcendent realm beyond our earthly experiences, he is adamant that something ethereal really does exist. Why?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The level of consciousness and alertness during near-death experiences (NDEs) is usually greater than that experienced in everyday life, even though NDEs generally occur when a person is unconscious or clinically dead,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/12/62ef0fb8-4f18-4044-ad44-ba386314ae10_ef4431ac.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From a purely medical perspective, this high level of consciousness while physically unconscious is inexplicable.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Second, he says, the vast majority of out-of-body experiences (OBEs), one of the most common elements of NDEs, are incredibly realistic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What NDErs see and hear of earthly events in the out-of-body state is almost always realistic. When the NDEr or others later seek to verify what was observed or heard during the NDE, the out-of-body experience observations are almost always confirmed as completely accurate,” Long says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Third, NDEs share common traits no matter where they happen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Near-death experiences appear remarkably consistent around the world, and across many different religions and cultures. NDEs from non-Western countries are remarkably similar to NDEs that occur in people in Western countries.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Long concludes: “These are all lines of evidence that near-death experiences, and their consistent message of an afterlife, are real.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmxpbm1gaINww8eaq2agkaW9prrSZpifrJWnerixjJ2gnmWemq6zecOemK2gXZrFsbHRopynm5WoerTBxqCcrKxdqLy2uIyapZ1lkZvBpr7Lop2eZZWttrTAjKyYsqtdmbykwM6rZLCgnw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happens-after-we-die-near-death-experiences-suggest-soul-and-afterlife-exist-says-doctor-who.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happens-after-we-die-near-death-experiences-suggest-soul-and-afterlife-exist-says-doctor-who.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happens-after-we-die-near-death-experiences-suggest-soul-and-afterlife-exist-says-doctor-who.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happens-after-we-die-near-death-experiences-suggest-soul-and-afterlife-exist-says-doctor-who.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happens-after-we-die-near-death-experiences-suggest-soul-and-afterlife-exist-says-doctor-who.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happens-after-we-die-near-death-experiences-suggest-soul-and-afterlife-exist-says-doctor-who.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./do-not-seek-absolution-i.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./do-not-seek-absolution-i.html>Do Not Seek Absolution I, Red Dead Redemption 2 Mission</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tim-reynolds.html>Tim Reynolds</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tim-reynolds.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
