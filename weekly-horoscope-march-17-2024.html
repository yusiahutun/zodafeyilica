<time>07 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Your <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>horoscope for the week of March 17 to 23</a> looks like a wild ride from start to finish. Even though difficult changes lie ahead, an energetic shift is exactly what you need.</p><p>The week starts with an extra dose of confusion, as a last quarter <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">moon in frantic and frenetic Gemini</a> could bring more anxiety than usual. That’s because it will square off with several planets in Pisces, upping our sensitivities and our bewilderment. And as <a href=#>the Pisces sun</a> forms a conjunction with Neptune on the early morning of March 17, you may feel like you’re disconnected from reality and fully steeped into a dreamworld. Getting out of bed on Sunday morning may feel almost impossible, especially if your dreams are more beautiful than reality.</p><p>The energy will begin to ramp on up March 19, as the sun will leave behind illusive Pisces <a href=#>and enter passionate Aries</a> at exactly 11:06 p.m. ET. This seasonal shift is also known as <a href=#>the “astrological new year”</a>, as Aries is the first sign in the zodiac. Aries is known for being active, competitive, aggressive, independent, and more courageous than you can possibly imagine. Enjoy this boost in confidence and stamina. And when the Aries sun immediately forms a sextile with transformative Pluto on March 21, you may feel inspired to fight for something meaningful to you. There’s never been a better time to remember that success is always the best revenge.</p><p>Unfortunately, March 21 is also when a very difficult aspect will take place—Venus conjunct <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Saturn in Pisces</a>. With Venus—<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>planet of love and friendship</a>—joining forces with Saturn—planet of restrictions—you may feel lonely, uninspired, and somewhat cold and distant from what you love. However, sometimes we need to take a step back and look at something from a rational perspective, as our emotions can often cloud our judgment. Let this be the beginning of a practical and pragmatic commitment in your love life and relationships.</p><p>On March 22, the creative and imaginative energy will reach a new peak, as Mars—<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">planet of action and primal instincts</a>—will enter dreamy, empathic, and unpredictable Pisces. Mars is a planet that loves to fight and Pisces is perfect for letting go of your ego. And during this Mars in Pisces transit, you’ll learn how to let passion drive your impulses without obscuring who you really are. Work for your higher self, not your egotistical self. You feel me?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-your-zodiac-sign-this-week>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.6846473029046><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_aries.png><p>This week, you are hitting the reset button.</p><p>The week begins on Sunday, March 17, with the sun conjoining Neptune in Pisces and your house of intuition.
