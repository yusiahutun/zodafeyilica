Check out our <a href=#>product research & curation process</a><p><a href=#><u>Hair oil</u></a> is one of the usual sources of nourishment that tends to prevent loss of moisture from the hair follicles – it maintains the water level within the keratinous cells of the hair shafts. However, with low-porosity hair, the assimilation of nutrients remains a hindrance hence the implementation of the best oils for low-porosity hair into one's hair care regime is a must. Besides, hair with low porosity has its cuticle layer loosely packed, with small pockets that allow moisture to pass into each strand, preventing dryness. At the same time, this can make your hair super greasy and oily.&nbsp;</p><p>The hair has several functions apart from amplifying the overall aesthetic appeal of an individual like facilitating osmoregulation and acting as a barrier against external entrants (<a href=#>1</a>). When it comes to maintaining our hair, oil can be a great ally. A good hair oil — grapeseed, argan, marula, jojoba, apricot, pomegranate, Kalahari melon seed, or sweet almond oil with low molecular weight, shields the hair against external pollutants and makes a way for nutrient absorption by elevating existing levels of hair porosity.&nbsp;</p><p>Lightweight hair oils contain smaller molecules that are easier to penetrate through the rigid shafts of the hair. These molecules tend to ease out the bonds of keratinous proteins, facilitating moisture absorption and accelerating hair growth. If you are struggling with low-porosity hair and wish to find a hair oil that suits you, we’ve mentioned a few recommendations below.</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>11 Best Hair Oils for Low Porosity Hair</h2></p><p>Mielle’s Scalp & Hair Strengthening oil tops the list of our recommendations in the category of best hair oils for low-porosity hair.
