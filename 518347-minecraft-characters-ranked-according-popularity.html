Just like Steve, Alex is the default player in the game. She provides players with the female option in the game; therefore, you are likely to meet her at the beginning, making her popular.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike Steve, she has slightly thinner arms and long hair, giving her a more feminine look. Her default clothing comprises a teal shirt, brown pants, and grey shoes. You can customise her as a player to give you your preferred look.</p><h3>4.

They were replaced by Zombified Piglins in the game, leading to their extinction. Zombie Pigmen can live in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">other species,</a> such as Magma cubes, Ghasts and Winter Skeletons.</p><p class=align-left>These characters can be easily identified by the sword in their right hand as well as their loincloth. They were also a combination of a zombie and a pig, having the body shape of a pig but the skin and behaviour of a zombie.</p><h3>6. Villager</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ee19f92e975f754b.jpg><p class=align-left>The Villager is a famous character in Minecraft games.

Many players attest that Herobrine still haunts them in their game world for appearing without an alarm with a disturbing presence. He is also known for his manipulative skill and mysterious ways in the game.</p><p class=align-left>The Herobrine legend emerged as a hoax, a form of an online horror story or urban legend. The myth suggests that Herobrine is a mysterious, powerful, and often evil figure resembling the default player, Steve, but has white, empty eyes.</p><h3>8. Wither Storm</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8571e30bfcb9857a.jpg><p class=align-left>The Wither Storm is a powerful and destructive creature that serves as the main antagonist in the first season of Minecraft: Story Mode.

It was programmed to adhere to the amulet of Gabriel the Warrior. However, a few errors caused it to spiral out of control and become unstoppable, destroying anything that stood in the path of the amulet. Jesse used a command block tool to demolish it in A Block and a Hard Place.</p><h3>9. Enderman</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5cc5b86bdb5e0c3a.jpg><p class=align-left>Endermen typically don't pay attention to players but run to fight those who hurt or stare them in the face. Endermen occasionally pick up specific blocks and use teleportation to avoid being hit by projectiles, sunlight, water (which is harmful to them), and other kinds of damage.</p><h3>10. Skeletons</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9784a49d7d2cbf0b.jpg><p class=align-left>Skeletons are aggressive, hostile mobs found in two dimensions and are known to drop expensive loot when killed. They are famous characters in Minecraft that often become more active at night.</p><p class=align-left>They are also characterised by their bony appearance and long-range attacks using bows and arrows. You can see them spawning in dimly lit or dark areas like caves and dungeons. Skeletons are crucial to the Minecraft game, providing players with resources during the game.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/14417b66ba8bd195.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 Disney movies with cats and feline animations to watch right now</span></p></a><h3>11.

You can tame wolves using bones from Skeletons after they are defeated.</p><p class=align-left>It is not easy to tame a wolf. However, this Minecraft character is useful in combat if well-tamed. Tamed wolves will automatically rush to defend their owner when hostile mobs attack the player. They cause damage by biting and can help fend off enemies.</p><h3>12. Ghast</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cde36147c6e9a5bb.jpg><p class=align-left>Ghasts are enormous, vicious, ghost-like floating white creatures who inhabit the Nether and unleash exploding fireballs at players. You can identify a Ghast by their distinctive wailing sounds and ability to shoot explosive fireballs at the player. Generally, they have a ghostly and intimidating look that scares their opponents or enemies.</p><h3>13. Blaze</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e945a9b6ebfd47fd.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ ugly cartoon characters, ranked by popularity in 2024</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fe0e7dc5647651fd.jpeg><p class=align-left>Blazes are popular Minecraft characters names known for their unique appearance and ability to shoot fireballs at players. They are categorised under the hostile mob, and they can spawn naturally. Attacking a Blaze with lava or fire is useless because they are immune to both.</p><p class=align-left>They will set their opponents on fire. However, when defeated, they drop their blaze rods which can be used to craft several other items. These Minecraft characters are known for targeting the player with 48 blocks. They can only shoot if they see their targeted opponent is in a clear line, destroying them.</p><h3>14. Magma Cubes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e4137d5576ce7587.jpg><p class=align-left>In the Nether, Magma cubes can be found in all lighting conditions. They must be able to spawn in an area free of solid obstacles and liquids. Magma Cubes can sprout atop magma blocks since they are essentially fireproof.

They are typically red or orange and emit particles that resemble sparks and smoke. They also come in different sizes; the smaller ones are less damaging than the larger ones.</p><h3>15. Ocelots and cats</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f7eacb0541ff5b6.jpg><p class=align-left>Ocelots are passive mobs that can be tamed into cats using raw fish. Even though the two have many similarities, you can identify them by their colours. Cats are smaller than Ocelots and come in different breeds and colours.

Phantoms</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/14417b66ba8bd195.jpeg><p class=align-left>Phantoms are flying hostile mobs that appear if a player hasn't slept for several in-game days.
