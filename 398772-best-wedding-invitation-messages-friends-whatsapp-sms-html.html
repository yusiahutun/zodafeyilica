I can’t wait to introduce my spouse to the world!</li><li>We have heard gazillions of times that marriages are made in heaven and celebrated on earth. Finally, we have realised it! To begin our happily ever after, I request the presence of my dearest friend to make our celebration more special.</li><li>I knew I would one day get a lovely bride/ groom. The day has come. I request you be in attendance as I walk down the aisle.</li><li>This is not just a day to have the most delicious food, have fun and wear the newest dresses. This is the day when we take the brand-new step in our relationship, which will be the first day of our married life. And this day will only be complete if my wonderful friends are there to see me tying the knot with my love. So, we want to invite you and your family to our festive day!</li><li>There are two things that will make us incredibly happy on the day of our wedding. The first one is our actual wedding, and the second one is you being here for us.</li><li>Love chose us, and I chose you to be a special guest at our wedding. Please, come here and be with me on this exciting day!</li><li>The special announcement, I am getting married this weekend! It is with pleasure that I invite you to the ceremony. Your presence means a lot to me. Food and drinks will be in plenty.</li><li>Walking down the aisle will be pointless if you are not here to cheer for us and give inappropriate whistles. Come to our wedding!</li><li>Next month we will make a first step towards our “happily ever after”, and we wanted you to share this moment with us! Join us for the ceremony on [date] at [venue].</li><li>As you know, I and my husband/wife-to-be are the perfect couple, but we sometimes think – where would we be if it was not for you? Come to our most special day – and don’t you dare miss it.</li><li>Without you, none of this would ever have happened. Thank you for everything you have done for us! I just want to ask you for something more – give me the honour of being there for us at the celebration of our endless love.</li><li>As I get married to the man/woman of my dreams, I would like you, my friends, to be by my side on the most important day of my life, guide me through the life-changing marriage ceremony and ease down my worries.</li><li>As roses are being picked for my big day, you are one of the best roses we wish to choose to attend the big day. Your presence will mean a lot.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/133069da17221c40.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to invite special guests to an event: Best invitation wording ideas</span></p></a><h3 id=398772-wedding-invitation-messages-for-colleagues class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Wedding invitation messages for colleagues</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/84b8d3598e2d2858.jpeg><p class=align-left>Invitation <a href=#>messages for colleagues</a> must be well thought-out.
