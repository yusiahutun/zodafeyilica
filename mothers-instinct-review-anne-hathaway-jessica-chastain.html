I was hugely inspired by the architecture of both of their houses. At the time, they are both homemakers so I was trying to understand how the house was a visual representation of them as well. I really got myself into the minds of these very different women. What I found really helpful was to look into vintage catalogues as if I was shopping.”</p><p id=e7pRRy_OIqd data-wc=77>“The period has been shown so many times in a way that starts to feel polished and perfect so it was really fun to get to play with the sense of how they get dressed when they leave the house versus how they get dressed when they stay in the house. I wanted to find flaws at different moments for each character and to chart the very different experiences they have after the death of this child.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/36885649ffd2-6000x4000-6000x4000-mi02847.jpg><p id=enfI8IkXL5 data-wc=54>Fashion fans will be captivated by the Pinterest-worthy wardrobes of Céline and Alice; think fitted dresses in bright shades of aquamarine, mint and yellow, accessorised with cat-eye sunglasses, top-handle bags and ivory silk gloves. The glamour is also dialled up with perfectly coiffed beehives and set waves, lush taffeta gowns and chic two-piece suits.</p><p id=efcWvyGkW0q data-wc=32>“Jessica and I both really love characters and we love to get specific about what makes people tick and how they put themselves together,” says Travers of his ongoing collaboration with Chastain.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/560032416bd8-4203x3362-4203x3362-mi02648.jpg><p id=eylciF4jN9 data-wc=64>"It was also wonderful to jump back into a fitting room with Anne because she brings so much to the table. She is truly such a joy to work with. She’s someone who has worn clothes so beautifully throughout her career so there's always a bit of pressure with her because you want to live up to the expectations. It was a real privilege.”</p><p id=eRV08iZYgJw7 data-wc=60>“Alice is a character who is interested in newer ideas, prints, and lighter-weight fabrics. She has a lot going on in her life. She had a career in a bigger city and came from a more flexible place. She is a dreamer, and we wanted this energy about her where she is lovely, dreamy, and a wonderful parent and wife."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/528e33642ed5-6000x4000-6000x4000-mi03446.jpg><p id=eRoufUpe4wya data-wc=79>“With Céline, it was the opposite where we looked at classics and perfectly starched linens. She has the energy of a political wife. We wanted her identity to be completely wrapped up in motherhood. This is the one thing that she pours all of herself into. So we wanted it to feel a little bit more maternal in a sense and a bit more staid and perfect. It was really fun to find that balance between the two women.”</p><p id=eMqyM2m7sj data-wc=56>As the story progresses from drama to suspense, you'll be gripped by the interplay between the magnetic Hathaway and Chastain as they navigate their complex roles of mother, friend, neighbour and protector. With love, rivalry, competition and fear explored against a tense soundtrack and lavish production design, audiences will be kept guessing until the very end.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5DoVernP8r4 data-wc=13><span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Mothers' Instinct</a></span> <strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5RqbHFuZmS6sMDHnqmsZZmjwLW1zZyrZqqVq7amw4yapaedXZ2utbTAsJiyZZqawLS1wppknKCRqMGitc1o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmothers-instinct-review-anne-hathaway-jessica-chastain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmothers-instinct-review-anne-hathaway-jessica-chastain.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmothers-instinct-review-anne-hathaway-jessica-chastain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmothers-instinct-review-anne-hathaway-jessica-chastain.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmothers-instinct-review-anne-hathaway-jessica-chastain.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmothers-instinct-review-anne-hathaway-jessica-chastain.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bailey-zimmerman-holy-smokes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bailey-zimmerman-holy-smokes.html>Bailey Zimmerman Reflects on Faith + Forbidden Love in New Song</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./home-exteriors-that-prove-curb-appeal-is-all-about-symmetry.html>15 Symmetrical House Pictures - Photos of Beautiful House Exterior Symmetry</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./home-exteriors-that-prove-curb-appeal-is-all-about-symmetry.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
