<time>26 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>There was so much that <a href=#>Diahann Carroll</a> achieved in her life and career, as was widely reflected on following <a href=#>news of her recent death</a>, but what needs to be emphasized is how groundbreaking she was in her achievements, particularly early on. For instance, in 1962 she became the first black actress to win the Best Actress <a href=#>Tony Award</a>, in her case for the Broadway musical No Strings. Then, perhaps more importantly given the audience she reached on a weekly basis, from 1968 to 1971 she was the first black actress to star in her own television series and to portray a character who wasn’t a stereotypical one.</p><p>The show was the <a href=#>Classic TV</a> comedy Julia, which saw her portraying a widow (her husband was a pilot shot down in Vietnam) raising a son (Corey, played by <strong>Marc Copage</strong>) alone. She’s hired as a nurse in the office of a doctor at a large aerospace company. In its own way, it was a show that seemed to allow Diahann to shatter the glass ceiling for other black women.</p><p></p><p>“Absolutely not,” she differed to Closer in an exclusive interview. “I had a wonderful writer, Hal Kanter, and he was thrilled to be doing this. He knew more than I understood at that time how important it was in the television industry to move along with these ideas. Coming into the world of television through Hal Kanter and several other people who were very much in my corner and very helpful, Julia was introduced in the magnificent way it should have been introduced. With 20th Century Fox and NBC I felt as though I had died and gone to heaven. It was just lovely. Everyone was so dedicated to making this something quite special.”</p><p>But not so special, she emphasized, that Diahann or the show could be credited with paving the way for people like <strong>Phylicia Rashad</strong> on The Cosby Show or <strong>Debbie Allen</strong>, her sister, who a part of the spinoff to that show, A Different World.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/diahann-carroll-julia-3.jpg><p>“I think there were a group of us who were forging the hood,” she noted. “At that time, I did not understand and Hal told me, ‘You’ll see what this is going to do.’ He was very proud and so was I. But the environment in which I was growing up also included other black performers, actresses, actors … everything. I knew it was going to be important, but it took a while for me to understand just how important and I’m very proud of it. When I see ‘her’ running around in her little hat and uniform, she’s adorable.”</p><p><strong>Please scroll down for more</strong></p><p>Be sure to check out and <a href=#>subscribe to our Classic TV & Film Podcast</a> for interviews with your favorite stars!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46doJqgkaO7bq%2FAq6mopJxiwbd50p6pop2jYre2uMiaZKudnZq6o7HRnptmmqliwamxjKWYrZ1dlrC1vsSsqmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdiahann-carroll-tv-series-julia-remembered-by-the-late-actress.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdiahann-carroll-tv-series-julia-remembered-by-the-late-actress.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdiahann-carroll-tv-series-julia-remembered-by-the-late-actress.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdiahann-carroll-tv-series-julia-remembered-by-the-late-actress.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdiahann-carroll-tv-series-julia-remembered-by-the-late-actress.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdiahann-carroll-tv-series-julia-remembered-by-the-late-actress.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jennifer-aniston-2010-golden-globes-valentino-dress-replica-the-morning-show-8363457.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jennifer-aniston-2010-golden-globes-valentino-dress-replica-the-morning-show-8363457.html>Jennifer Aniston Just Wore a Replica of Her 2010 Golden Globes Valentino Gown on &amp;quot;The Morning Show&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./6630259022601d06348b45fe-html.html>Dallas Cowboys le da una segunda oportunidad Ezekiel Elliott al llegar a un acuerdo de contrato</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./6630259022601d06348b45fe-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
